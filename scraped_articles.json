David Perdue for snatching his phone when he asked about voting rights", "text": "A Georgia student who says Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) snatched his cellphone away this month as he tried to ask about possible voter suppression in the state has filed a lawsuit against the lawmaker for battery.\n\nAttorneys for Nathan Knauf, a junior at Georgia Tech, filed the complaint in Fulton County State Court on Monday morning, seeking a jury trial, unspecified damages, attorneys' fees and others costs from Perdue.\n\nPerdue\u2019s office has maintained that the exchange was a misunderstanding and that the senator took the student\u2019s phone to take a selfie. On Monday, Perdue\u2019s office called the lawsuit \u201coutrageous and completely frivolous.\u201d\n\nThe incident took place Oct. 13, when Perdue visited Georgia Tech to campaign for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican who is locked in a tight gubernatorial race with Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\nKnauf, a student member of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, approached Perdue and began asking about Kemp \u2014 who has been accused of suppressing thousands of minority voters \u2014 while recording video on his cellphone.\n\n\u201cHey, so, uh, how can you endorse a candidate,\" Knauf began.\n\nBefore he could continue, Perdue snatched the phone out of his hands.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not doing that.

I\u2019m going to give it to you,\u201d Perdue continues, ignoring the student\u2019s request. \u201cYou wanted a picture?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me my phone back, Senator,\u201d Knauf repeats.\n\nAt this point, the video rights itself again, apparently because Knauf is reunited with his phone. By then, Perdue is walking away on a crowded pedestrian pathway.\n\nThe following day, Perdue\u2019s office characterized the exchange as a misunderstanding and said the senator had spent several hours meeting with hundreds of people at a Georgia Tech game over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe senator spoke with many students and answered questions on a variety of topics,\u201d Perdue spokeswoman Casey Black said in a statement at the time. \u201cIn this instance, the senator clearly thought he was being asked to take a picture, and he went to take a selfie as he often does. When he realized they didn\u2019t actually want to take a picture, he gave the phone back.\u201d\n\nKnauf\u2019s attorneys said Knauf and two friends had asked Perdue to take a picture with them but had not agreed to hand over his phone. The complaint states that Perdue \u201ccould not have thought that Mr. Knauf had somehow changed his mind and now wanted a selfie taken.\u201d\n\nMichael Sterling, one of Knauf\u2019s attorneys, argued that the video evidence does not corroborate Perdue\u2019s explanation.\n\n\u201cThis is a first-year law school definition of battery,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cPerdue starts by saying \u2018No, I\u2019m not doing that,\u2019 and then snatches the phone. Then Perdue puts the phone behind his back. There\u2019s no actions that are consistent with the fact that he was going to take a selfie. He doesn\u2019t put the phone up. . . . Nate is asking for his phone back. That\u2019s completely inconsistent with [Perdue\u2019s] version of the story.\u201d\n\n[A senator snatched a student\u2019s phone while being asked about Georgia voter registration uproar]\n\nGeorgia state Rep. David Dreyer (D), another of Knauf\u2019s attorneys, said they opted to file a civil complaint rather than a criminal one.\n\n\u201cWe think he should be held accountable, but we didn\u2019t think it rose to the level of trying to have him prosecuted,\u201d Dreyer said of Perdue. \u201cBy filing a lawsuit, we are empowering a jury to determine whether Nate\u2019s story is right or whether Senator Perdue\u2019s story is right.\u201d\n\nKnauf\u2019s attorneys said the student would be willing to dismiss the civil complaint if Perdue issued an apology \u201cfor both misleading the public and for trying to intimidate him,\u201d and also to answer Knauf\u2019s original question about his support for Kemp.\n\n\u201cThe two issues at stake here are [about] democracy: Can an individual, an everyday person, go up to their elected representative and ask a question in a public forum?\u201d Dreyer said. \u201cAnd does the rule of law apply \u2014 whether it\u2019s a college student or a multimillionaire U.S. senator? Because we know if Mr. Knauf had taken the phone from Sen. Perdue, he would have been put in jail.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Monday morning, Perdue\u2019s office characterized the lawsuit as one being \u201cpolitically orchestrated by Georgia Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe senator was simply asked to take a picture and went to take a selfie as he often does with hundreds of people,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe senator was also not ignoring their questions, in fact, he had just finished answering several students\u2019 questions about climate change.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cSadly, but not surprisingly, this is another attempt by liberal activists to distort the facts and distract the people of Georgia just weeks before an election.\u201d\n\n[Georgia\u2019s GOP gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp is sued over claims of suppressing thousands of minority voters]\n\nWhen asked to respond to the student\u2019s offer to dismiss the complaint if Perdue apologized, the senator\u2019s spokeswoman said in a follow-up statement that \u201cGeorgia Democrats have taken their extreme tactics too far\" and called Knauf\u2019s attorneys \u201cpolitical hacks who are trying to spin something out of nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is being orchestrated by a former Obama operative and current Democrat state representative who spends most of his time campaigning for Stacey Abrams,\u201d she stated. \"Georgians will see this for what it is \u2014 a manufactured setup to embarrass the Senator and attack his credibility two weeks before the midterm elections. Instead, Democrats are embarrassing themselves with a frivolous case that will only waste the court\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia governor\u2019s race between Kemp and Abrams attracted national scrutiny this month after the Associated Press reported that more than 53,000 voter registration applications were in limbo with Kemp\u2019s office; the overwhelming majority of those applications are from African American and other minority voters, according to an AP analysis.\n\nAbrams has accused Kemp of voter suppression and of using his position to try to swing the gubernatorial race in his favor. Kemp has defended his office by saying it was simply complying with an \u201cexact match\u201d state law that requires election officials to put a registration application on hold if there are even minor discrepancies with existing records (for instance, a typo or an extra hyphen in a name).\n\nThe controversy escalated when a coalition of civil rights groups sued Kemp over the exact-match law, arguing that it disproportionately and unfairly affects minority voters.\n\nPolls show the race between Kemp and Abrams is a toss-up.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\nGuardian reporter calls GOP congressman who hit him a coward \u2014 and calls Trump something worse\n\n\u2018Who did this?!\u2019: Someone put googly eyes on a historic Georgia statue.

One such example was a girl \u201cthat he took in his arms and drove home several times,\u201d Blaquart said, according to local reports.\n\n[Justice Department investigates abuse by Catholic clergy in Pennsylvania]\n\nBlaquart had told Fumery to take some time off to seek counseling and leave town after the allegations surfaced but said that the claims did not merit being reported to the authorities, the BBC and AFP reported. The priest had only recently returned to Gien after a break.\n\nScrutiny on the issue of child sexual abuse has intensified in the wake of an August report from a grand jury in Pennsylvania that found more than 300 Catholic priests had abused children over seven decades while they were protected by church leaders.\n\nThe product of an 18-month investigation into six dioceses in the state, the report identified at least 1,000 child victims and noted that there were probably thousands more.\n\nThe Justice Department has launched an investigation into the allegations, it was disclosed last week.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Devlin Barrett, Julie Zauzmer and Michelle Boorstein wrote:\n\nThe decision to launch such a probe, even one limited to a single state, is noteworthy because the federal government has long shied away from tackling allegations that the church spent decades hiding the extent of the sexual abuse problem among its priests and that it allowed pedophiles to continue to work and live undetected in communities.\n\nRead more:\n\nMore than 300 accused priests listed in Pennsylvania report on Catholic Church sex abuse\n\nUtah refused to prosecute their sexual assault cases, so four women set out to do it themselves\n\nA \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 voter panel rebels when asked about the migrant caravan\n\nA \u2018headless chicken monster\u2019 sighting shows just how little we know about the ocean off Antarctica", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2018/10/22/another-french-priest-accused-sexual-assault-commits-suicide/?utm_term=.f2ee3e559af7", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Utah refused to prosecute four sexual assault cases, so the alleged victims set out to do it themselves", "text": "One petitioner was a 17-year-old high school senior when she alleged that a classmate had raped her. Another claimed her co-worker had assaulted her. The third petitioner accused a police chief of raping her several times while she was volunteering in his department. And the fourth, now 30, said she was assaulted by a massage therapist.\n\nAll four cases were reviewed by the local prosecutor\u2019s office, which declined to file charges.\n\nNow the four Utah residents are using a novel approach to make their voices heard: a provision in the state\u2019s constitution that permits alleged crime victims to request that the state Supreme Court appoint a prosecutor if a district attorney refuses a case.\n\nThe constitutional clause is unique to Utah, but the concept of victim-initiated prosecution is available in other states.\n\nAttorneys for the women are optimistic that if they succeed in Salt Lake County, the ruling will create a viable blueprint for other states.\n\nSalt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill called the petition an \u201cintriguing thing that\u2019s never been challenged.\u201d Still, Gill joins a number of lawyers who worry that a successful lawsuit will pave the way for thousands of frivolous petitions in many types of cases.\n\nIn the past two years, all four women \u2014 known in their recently filed lawsuit as \u201cthe Jane Does\u201d \u2014 said they were attacked by someone they knew and reported the assault within days.\n\nJane Doe 1, now 18, told The Washington Post that she hopes to help other victims be heard.\n\nAfter the Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute the case, the teenager\u2019s high school allowed her alleged rapist back on campus.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel so vulnerable and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think the law will protect those who have been wronged. I don\u2019t want another girl going through this again. I want to make it easier to get help and to have the law believe you.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is the first time in Utah\u2019s 120-year history that anyone has approached the issue this way, Paul Cassell, a former federal judge and professor at the University of Utah\u2019s S.J. Quinney College of Law, told The Post.\n\nHistorically, the nation rarely questions a law enforcement decision to decline bringing charges. \u201cThe sexual assault under-prosecution problem is forcing people to reevaluate that,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of requesting sweeping interference with law enforcement decisions, the lawsuit asks for a specific ruling on a case that has been turned down for prosecution.\n\n[Police in many states could legally have sex with a person in custody \u2014 until a N.Y. rape allegation]\n\nThe suit comes amid heated national dialogue about sexual abuse, as the #MeToo movement has emboldened more women to speak out. It was further fueled by the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, which were shadowed by outrage over decades-old allegations of sexual assault.\n\nThe consensus, according to attorney Bethany Warr, who represents three of the Jane Does, is that sexual assault cases are under-prosecuted, though there are places where it\u2019s more pronounced than others.\n\n\u201cThey have a tendency to be declined by district attorneys, and fairly so \u2014 they\u2019re difficult cases,\u201d Warr said. The lawsuit aims to further the dialogue about why juries are so hard on sex-crime victims and why society has such a hard time believing them, she said.\n\nSex-crime prosecutions are widely accepted as some of the most challenging in the criminal justice system.\n\nSexual assaults rarely happen with other witnesses present, and anything that deviates from the cliche of a masked, armed man committing a rape in an alleyway adds a variable that must be explained to frequently judgmental juries.\n\nIn Salt Lake County, Cassell said, assistant district attorneys operate under outdated notions of what cases are winnable, saying that prosecutors who are fearful of losing are the real barrier to successful prosecutions.\n\nGill, who is up for reelection this year, agreed that these are difficult cases for prosecutors. But, he said, that doesn\u2019t mean his office refuses to prosecute them.\n\nAn average of 44 percent of violent crimes are reported to law enforcement and result in arrest, according to a statement released by Gill on Tuesday. Sexual crimes, he said, vary dramatically.\n\nIn Utah, 12 percent are brought forward \u2014 meaning 88 of 100 people fail to report sexual assault claims, Gill told The Post. He also said that last year, his office filed charges in 39 to 40 percent of 600 sexual assault reports, consistent with the national average.\n\nGill said there\u2019s a social stigma associated with sexual assault, and because only a small percentage are reported, a systemic attrition happens.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure out what the balance is \u2014 to reassure victims that we see and hear them, while asking if the interests of justice will be met by bringing the case forward. Can we meet the legal burden in good faith?\u201d\n\nGill pointed out that sexual assault cases have nuanced complexity. One major consideration, he said, is whether to re-traumatize a victim by having her testify in a case that would be challenging to win.\n\nDeborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Law and a former prosecutor, said, \u201cThe problem with prosecutors is that they\u2019re not just thinking about legal sufficiency, they\u2019re thinking about convictability\u201d \u2014 the likelihood that 12 jurors can be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cOften, jurors are unpersuaded because of biases and rape myths. When prosecutors take that into account in charging decisions, even anticipatorily, they\u2019re embedding them into the system.\u201d\n\nThe #MeToo movement heightened awareness of the prevalence of sexual assault. Part of the benefit is that people better understand what sexual violence looks like, which mitigates assumptions about the type of person who perpetrates these crimes and how a survivor \u201cshould\u201d behave, Tuerkheimer said.\n\nThe petitioners remain hopeful that the Utah Supreme Court, which has the petition under advisement, will direct the attorney general\u2019s office and other government agencies to file briefs in response.\n\nEach of the Jane Does wants to fight for the right to hold her alleged abuser accountable. Jane Doe 4 told the Salt Lake Tribune: \u201cI did everything that I needed to do and I did it as strongly as I could,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how disappointing and heartbreaking it would be.\u201d\n\nBy putting their stories into circulation, they hope to challenge old injustices and forge change within the criminal justice system.\n\nRead more:\n\nFormer state GOP official warns Trump protesters: Montana is an \u2018open carry state\u2019\n\nA black child\u2019s backpack brushed up against a woman.

Most of them hope to seek asylum at the border or \u2014 more likely \u2014 to try to cross into the United States illegally.\n\nSo despite the caravan\u2019s size, it\u2019s no different in purpose than smaller mass migrations that routinely cross Central America.\n\nThe last one passed through last spring, drawing its own entourage of reporters and outraged tweets from Trump. It grew to about 1,000 people, which, it turned out, was too large for purposes of logistics, and so the caravan disbanded in Mexico City long before it reached the U.S. border.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how a group at least five times larger \u2014 apparently reliant on food and water from passersby \u2014 hopes to make it any farther.\n\nThat context was not in Monday\u2019s Fox News alert.\n\nSome of it came across later in the episode \u2014 perhaps unintentionally \u2014 when Doocy brought out a panel of four people identified as independent voters and asked about the caravan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s north of apparently 7,000 people strong,\u201d Doocy told the first independent voter, Michael Willner. \u201cHow big a problem is that, that the United States has uneven immigration laws?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think uneven immigration laws are a problem for any country, and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated,\u201d Willner said.\n\n[\u2018He chose to blow it\u2019: A rare dissent from the couch of \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 after Trump attacks Ford]\n\n\u201cBut this country is founded on immigration,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd all of us come from immigrants.\u201d\n\nDoocy tried again.\n\n\u201cBy the time it gets here, it could be 10,000. It could be 20,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat should the United States do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the mightiest country on the planet,\u201d Willner replied. \u201cI think we can handle a caravan of people, unarmed, coming to this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Doocy said, pointing to the second independent voter. \u201cCathy: real quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the immigration crisis we\u2019re seeing is a result of the failure of the two democratic parties to actually engage the issue,\u201d said Cathy Stewart, with the New York Independence Party.\n\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d said Doocy.\n\n\u201cInstead, they use it like a partisan football,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Doocy. And, moving on: \u201cJohn, real quick.\u201d\n\nBut John Opdyke continued the previous independent voters' line of thought.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a humanitarian crisis taking place in Central America, and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s very little honest discussion about what\u2019s actually happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Aaron?\u201d Doocy said. His voice had fallen to something like a raspy whisper.\n\n\u201cTreating this as an \u2018invasion\u2019 is a bad idea, and it\u2019s going to end horribly if it is treated such as that way,\u201d said Aaron Commey, a libertarian and the final independent voter on the panel.\n\nDoocy collected his notes and sat up on his stool.\n\n\u201cSure, but the backdrop is the midterms, so it all becomes political,\u201d he told the voters. \u201cSo let\u2019s see what happens!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Fox & Friends dispensed with Monday\u2019s migrant news alert and moved on to the subject of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe next episode airs Tuesday morning. Perhaps another Fox News alert will pop up then, too.\n\nRead more:\n\nNavigating the border: The barriers that define the U.S.-Mexico borderline", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/fox-friends-voter-panel-rebels-when-asked-about-migrant-caravan/?utm_term=.0c9b51e623e6", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_politics": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/politics", "articles": [{"title": "Rick Scott announces that he's running for Senate, challenging Bill Nelson", "text": "Washington (CNN) Florida Republican Gov.

She also highlighted the deaths of 14 seniors in a nursing home during Hurricane Irma and accused Scott of deflecting blame for the Parkland shooting and the Florida International University bridge collapse that killed six people.\n\nMyers pointed out that Scott's gubernatorial wins in 2010 and 2014 came in tight races, and that Florida has seen a shift in Democrats' favor since Trump took office -- including wins in the St. Petersburg mayoral race and two hotly contested state legislative special elections.\n\n\"Scott's self-serving political brand, his administration's failures and a hostile political environment will all cripple his campaign,\" Myers said.\n\nSouth Dakota Republican Sen.

The numbers may not be as good as advertised for Democrats Gillum and Nelson or as bad for Republicans Ron DeSantis or Rick Scott.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, the CNN poll conducted Tuesday through Saturday shows Gillum with support from 54 percent of likely voters to 42 percent for DeSantis. That\u2019s a 12 percentage point advantage for Gillum.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, CNN has Nelson leading Scott among likely voters, 50 percent to 45 percent. That\u2019s a Nelson lead of 5 points.\n\nCNN has the famous brand name, but its poll might be overstating support for the Democratic candidates and understating support for the Republicans.\n\nAnother survey, from SEA Polling & Strategic Design, which generally polls for Democrats, found closer contests.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, SEA found 48 percent for Gillum to 42 percent for DeSantis among registered voters.\n\nIn the Senate race, SEA found Scott leading Nelson, 47 percent to 45 percent among registered voters.\n\nThe poll from SEA was conducted from Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nGillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, is currently the mayor of Tallahassee. Republican DeSantis was serving his third term as a member of Congress from northeast Florida until he resigned last month to campaign full time.\n\nThe candidates met for their first debate Sunday night.\n\nDemocrat Nelson is seeking a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. Republican Gov. Rick Scott can\u2019t run for a third term as governor because of term limits, so he is running against Nelson.\n\nBolstering the CNN numbers was a Quinnipiac University Poll of the Senate race released on Monday. The poll found Nelson with 52 percent support among likely voters to 46 percent for Scott.\n\nQuinnipiac hasn\u2019t released results in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nAmong the reasons to be cautious about the CNN numbers:\n\n-- Trump response \u2014 The CNN survey found more Florida voters disapprove (50 percent) than approve (42 percent) of President Donald Trump\u2019s performance, a net negative of 8 percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Virtually every public opinion poll shows more disapproval than approval for the president.\n\nWhat is unusual is the comparison to the national average. RealClearPolitics reports the average of national polls shows 52 percent disapproval and 44 percent approval of Trump, a net negative of 8 points.\n\nThat\u2019s strikingly similar to the percentages CNN reported in Florida. Throughout his presidency, Trump has had notably higher favorable percentages and lower unfavorable percentages in Florida than the nation.\n\nThe Quinnipiac Poll reported Trump\u2019s approval at 46 percent positive to 51 percent negative.\n\n-- Hurricane Michael \u2014 The disruptions in electricity and phone service caused by the hurricane in the Panhandle \u2013 strong Republican territory \u2014 might change the composition of the people polled. It\u2019s impossible to know how many Panhandle voters won\u2019t participate in this year\u2019s election.\n\n-- Methodology. The CNN survey asked people to describe their affiliations, with 32 percent Democrats, 29 percent Republican, and 39 percent independent.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign said the methodology of the poll is seriously flawed, which \u201crenders the finding useless.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said the sample \u201chas more Independent voters than Democrats or Republicans and more Democrats than Republicans. However, in the 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 general elections more Republicans voted than Democrats or Independents.\u201d\n\nStephen Lawson, a DeSantis spokesman, said in a written statement that the poll shows \u201cwhy so many Americans believe that CNN peddles fake news.\u201d\n\nCNN said its mix of Democrats, Republicans and voters who have no party affiliation or are members of a third party \u201calmost exactly matches\u201d the state\u2019s registered voters.\n\n-- Outlier. Some polls are considered \u201coutliers\u201d by political professionals, meaning that for a variety of reasons they don\u2019t get a good sample and the conclusions raise skepticism. Some political analysts have suggested the CNN poll might be an outlier.\n\nUntil the CNN poll released Sunday, the RealClearPolitics polling average had Gillum and DeSantis just 1 percentage point apart, with 45.3 percent for Gillum and 44.3 percent for DeSantis. Without CNN, the RealClearPolitics average in the Senate race had Scott and Nelson tied at 46.3 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that there\u2019s been a big recent surge toward Gillum and Nelson, or the CNN poll could be an outlier.\n\nThe cable network acknowledged those possibilities in an article it published Monday about the poll. \u201cThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance. It also could be an indicator of renewed Democratic enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThe fine print\n\nIn the CNN poll, the research company SSRS used live callers to reach 759 likely voters by phone from Tuesday through Saturday. For likely voters, the pollster said the margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nSEA said it used live callers to reach 600 registered voters and said its margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nQuinnipiac surveyed 1,161 likely voters from Wednesday through Sunday using live callers. It reported a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\naman@sunsentinel.com, 954-356-4550 or Twitter @browardpolitics", "link": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-andrew-gillum-bill-nelson-cnn-poll-20181022-story.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "CNN Poll: Democrats up in Florida with two weeks to go", "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) As the final two weeks of campaigning begin, Democrats hold an edge in both the gubernatorial and Senate contests in the key state of Florida, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.

Ron DeSantis in the race for governor, while the Senate contest is a closer matchup with incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson at 50% to Republican Gov. Rick Scott's 45%.\n\nGillum's 54% to 42% lead rests on advantages among women (60% back him vs. 34% who say they favor DeSantis), non-white voters (74% back Gillum, 23% DeSantis), younger voters (60% for Gillum, 33% for DeSantis) and political independents (51% back Gillum, 42% DeSantis). Gillum has also consolidated Democratic support (97% favor him) in a way that DeSantis has not matched on the Republican side (88% back him).\n\nViews of Donald Trump are about as polarizing as partisanship in this race, which Trump has tweeted about multiple times. Among the 51% of likely voters who disapprove of the president, 92% back Gillum, while 87% back DeSantis among the 43% who approve of Trump.\n\nThe poll shows a wider lead for Gillum than some other recent telephone polling, nearly all of which was conducted before Hurricane Michael struck the state on October 10. Before the storm, public polling in mid- to late-September on these contests was mixed, with some (including surveys from Mason-Dixon and the University of North Florida) finding near-even races while others (including the Quinnipiac University and NBC News/Marist polls) gave the Democratic candidates the edge.\n\nThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance.
