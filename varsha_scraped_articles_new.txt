The numbers may not be as good as advertised for Democrats Gillum and Nelson or as bad for Republicans Ron DeSantis or Rick Scott.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, the CNN poll conducted Tuesday through Saturday shows Gillum with support from 54 percent of likely voters to 42 percent for DeSantis. That\u2019s a 12 percentage point advantage for Gillum.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, CNN has Nelson leading Scott among likely voters, 50 percent to 45 percent. That\u2019s a Nelson lead of 5 points.\n\nCNN has the famous brand name, but its poll might be overstating support for the Democratic candidates and understating support for the Republicans.\n\nAnother survey, from SEA Polling & Strategic Design, which generally polls for Democrats, found closer contests.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, SEA found 48 percent for Gillum to 42 percent for DeSantis among registered voters.\n\nIn the Senate race, SEA found Scott leading Nelson, 47 percent to 45 percent among registered voters.\n\nThe poll from SEA was conducted from Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nGillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, is currently the mayor of Tallahassee. Republican DeSantis was serving his third term as a member of Congress from northeast Florida until he resigned last month to campaign full time.\n\nThe candidates met for their first debate Sunday night.\n\nDemocrat Nelson is seeking a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. Republican Gov. Rick Scott can\u2019t run for a third term as governor because of term limits, so he is running against Nelson.\n\nBolstering the CNN numbers was a Quinnipiac University Poll of the Senate race released on Monday. The poll found Nelson with 52 percent support among likely voters to 46 percent for Scott.\n\nQuinnipiac hasn\u2019t released results in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nAmong the reasons to be cautious about the CNN numbers:\n\n-- Trump response \u2014 The CNN survey found more Florida voters disapprove (50 percent) than approve (42 percent) of President Donald Trump\u2019s performance, a net negative of 8 percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Virtually every public opinion poll shows more disapproval than approval for the president.\n\nWhat is unusual is the comparison to the national average. RealClearPolitics reports the average of national polls shows 52 percent disapproval and 44 percent approval of Trump, a net negative of 8 points.\n\nThat\u2019s strikingly similar to the percentages CNN reported in Florida. Throughout his presidency, Trump has had notably higher favorable percentages and lower unfavorable percentages in Florida than the nation.\n\nThe Quinnipiac Poll reported Trump\u2019s approval at 46 percent positive to 51 percent negative.\n\n-- Hurricane Michael \u2014 The disruptions in electricity and phone service caused by the hurricane in the Panhandle \u2013 strong Republican territory \u2014 might change the composition of the people polled. It\u2019s impossible to know how many Panhandle voters won\u2019t participate in this year\u2019s election.\n\n-- Methodology. The CNN survey asked people to describe their affiliations, with 32 percent Democrats, 29 percent Republican, and 39 percent independent.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign said the methodology of the poll is seriously flawed, which \u201crenders the finding useless.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said the sample \u201chas more Independent voters than Democrats or Republicans and more Democrats than Republicans. However, in the 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 general elections more Republicans voted than Democrats or Independents.\u201d\n\nStephen Lawson, a DeSantis spokesman, said in a written statement that the poll shows \u201cwhy so many Americans believe that CNN peddles fake news.\u201d\n\nCNN said its mix of Democrats, Republicans and voters who have no party affiliation or are members of a third party \u201calmost exactly matches\u201d the state\u2019s registered voters.\n\n-- Outlier. Some polls are considered \u201coutliers\u201d by political professionals, meaning that for a variety of reasons they don\u2019t get a good sample and the conclusions raise skepticism. Some political analysts have suggested the CNN poll might be an outlier.\n\nUntil the CNN poll released Sunday, the RealClearPolitics polling average had Gillum and DeSantis just 1 percentage point apart, with 45.3 percent for Gillum and 44.3 percent for DeSantis. Without CNN, the RealClearPolitics average in the Senate race had Scott and Nelson tied at 46.3 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that there\u2019s been a big recent surge toward Gillum and Nelson, or the CNN poll could be an outlier.\n\nThe cable network acknowledged those possibilities in an article it published Monday about the poll. \u201cThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance. It also could be an indicator of renewed Democratic enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThe fine print\n\nIn the CNN poll, the research company SSRS used live callers to reach 769 likely voters by phone from Tuesday through Saturday. For likely voters, the pollster said the margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nSEA said it used live callers to reach 600 registered voters and said its margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nQuinnipiac surveyed 1,161 likely voters from Wednesday through Sunday using live callers. It reported a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\naman@sunsentinel.com, 954-356-4550 or Twitter @browardpolitics", "link": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-andrew-gillum-bill-nelson-cnn-poll-20181022-story.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "CNN Poll: Democrats up in Florida with two weeks to go", "text": "WASHINGTON (CNN) As the final two weeks of campaigning begin, Democrats hold an edge in both the gubernatorial and Senate contests in the key state of Florida, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum holds a wide 12-point edge over his Republican opponent Rep. Ron DeSantis in the race for governor, while the Senate contest is a closer matchup with incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson at 50% to Republican Gov. Rick Scott's 45%.\n\nGillum's 54% to 42% lead rests on advantages among women (60% back him vs. 34% who say they favor DeSantis), non-white voters (74% back Gillum, 23% DeSantis), younger voters (60% for Gillum, 33% for DeSantis) and political independents (51% back Gillum, 42% DeSantis). Gillum has also consolidated Democratic support (97% favor him) in a way that DeSantis has not matched on the Republican side (88% back him).\n\nViews of Donald Trump are about as polarizing as partisanship in this race, which Trump has tweeted about multiple times. Among the 51% of likely voters who disapprove of the president, 92% back Gillum, while 87% back DeSantis among the 43% who approve of Trump.\n\nThe poll shows a wider lead for Gillum than some other recent telephone polling, nearly all of which was conducted before Hurricane Michael struck the state on October 10. Before the storm, public polling in mid- to late-September on these contests was mixed, with some (including surveys from Mason-Dixon and the University of North Florida) finding near-even races while others (including the Quinnipiac University and NBC News/Marist polls) gave the Democratic candidates the edge.\n\nThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance. It also could be an indicator of renewed Democratic enthusiasm.\n\nRead More", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/21/politics/cnn-poll-florida-senate-governor/index.html", "published": "2018-10-21T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Rick Scott": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/09/politics/rick-scott-bill-nelson-florida/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate", "text": "Washington (CNN) There are two months until the midterm elections in November and Democrats still have a narrow path to the Senate majority despite a map that favors Republicans and includes 10 Democratic incumbents running in states President Donald Trump won, five of them by double-digit margins.\n\nThe President carried Indiana and Missouri by 19 points each, but a pair of new polls released this week by NBC News/Marist show Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill waging competitive re-election fights. In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party. But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/09/politics/cnn-key-races-senate-update-early-september/index.html", "published": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive", "text": "In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor's race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches.\n\nAs a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation's health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law -- which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- are on the defensive.\n\nFor many GOP candidates, it's the first time they've been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions.\n\nThe American public has swung drastically in Democrats' favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far -- but now, that's down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it's either about right (21%) or didn't go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money.\n\nSeizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nThe pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning -- insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they'd do that.\n\nEven Republicans who haven't voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care.\n\nIn Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years.\n\nBut a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans.\n\nWhat Braun doesn't say in his ads: His company's insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun's auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.\n\nThe average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.\n\n\"Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,\" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.\n\nAnd Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.\n\n\"While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.\n\nOne of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.\n\nCruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \"every single word\" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.\n\nNow, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.\n\n\"You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,\" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.\n\nCruz touted his \"Consumer Freedom Amendment,\" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.\n\nHis Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: \"I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.\n\nIn the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \"rare chronic disease\" earlier this year -- \"a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.\"\n\n\"I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\" Hawley says in the ad.\n\nWanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018\n\nHowever, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law.\n\nIf they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare's mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Nerve,\" McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley's ad. \"He sues to wipe out the protection then 'goes to camera' to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.\"\n\nAnd this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then \"goes to camera\" to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 25, 2018\n\nIn a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.\n\nHowever, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.\n\nRepublicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.\n\nIn hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.\n\nIn at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.\n\nThe Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \"DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer \"Medicare for all,\" saying that Gillum is running on a plan \"that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\"\n\nBut, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.\n\nIn Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.\n\nRosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were \"LIES!!!\" and that he is \"going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/politics/republicans-health-care-defensive/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Dean Heller": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/dean-heller-trump/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate", "text": "Washington (CNN) There are two months until the midterm elections in November and Democrats still have a narrow path to the Senate majority despite a map that favors Republicans and includes 10 Democratic incumbents running in states President Donald Trump won, five of them by double-digit margins.\n\nThe President carried Indiana and Missouri by 19 points each, but a pair of new polls released this week by NBC News/Marist show Democratic Sens.

In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018.

But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/09/politics/cnn-key-races-senate-update-early-september/index.html", "published": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive", "text": "In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor's race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches.\n\nAs a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation's health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law -- which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- are on the defensive.\n\nFor many GOP candidates, it's the first time they've been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions.\n\nThe American public has swung drastically in Democrats' favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far -- but now, that's down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it's either about right (21%) or didn't go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money.\n\nSeizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nThe pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning -- insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they'd do that.\n\nEven Republicans who haven't voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care.\n\nIn Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years.\n\nBut a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans.\n\nWhat Braun doesn't say in his ads: His company's insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun's auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.\n\nThe average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.\n\n\"Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,\" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.\n\nAnd Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.\n\n\"While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.\n\nOne of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.\n\nCruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \"every single word\" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.\n\nNow, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.\n\n\"You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,\" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.\n\nCruz touted his \"Consumer Freedom Amendment,\" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.\n\nHis Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: \"I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.\n\nIn the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \"rare chronic disease\" earlier this year -- \"a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.\"\n\n\"I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\" Hawley says in the ad.\n\nWanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018\n\nHowever, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law.\n\nIf they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare's mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Nerve,\" McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley's ad. \"He sues to wipe out the protection then 'goes to camera' to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.\"\n\nAnd this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then \"goes to camera\" to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 25, 2018\n\nIn a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.\n\nHowever, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.\n\nRepublicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.\n\nIn hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.\n\nIn at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.\n\nThe Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \"DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer \"Medicare for all,\" saying that Gillum is running on a plan \"that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\"\n\nBut, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.\n\nIn Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.\n\nRosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were \"LIES!!!\" and that he is \"going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/politics/republicans-health-care-defensive/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Jacky Rosen": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/06/politics/womens-vote-key-states/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate", "text": "Washington (CNN) There are two months until the midterm elections in November and Democrats still have a narrow path to the Senate majority despite a map that favors Republicans and includes 10 Democratic incumbents running in states President Donald Trump won, five of them by double-digit margins.\n\nThe President carried Indiana and Missouri by 19 points each, but a pair of new polls released this week by NBC News/Marist show Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill waging competitive re-election fights. In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party. But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz.

The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen.

Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen.

High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.\n\nThe average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.\n\n\"Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,\" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.\n\nAnd Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.\n\n\"While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.\n\nOne of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.\n\nCruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \"every single word\" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.\n\nNow, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.\n\n\"You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,\" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.\n\nCruz touted his \"Consumer Freedom Amendment,\" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.\n\nHis Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: \"I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.\n\nIn the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \"rare chronic disease\" earlier this year -- \"a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.\"\n\n\"I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\" Hawley says in the ad.\n\nWanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018\n\nHowever, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law.\n\nIf they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare's mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Nerve,\" McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley's ad. \"He sues to wipe out the protection then 'goes to camera' to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.\"\n\nAnd this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then \"goes to camera\" to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 25, 2018\n\nIn a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.\n\nHowever, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.\n\nRepublicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.\n\nIn hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.\n\nIn at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.\n\nThe Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \"DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer \"Medicare for all,\" saying that Gillum is running on a plan \"that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\"\n\nBut, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.\n\nIn Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.\n\nRosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were \"LIES!!!\" and that he is \"going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/politics/republicans-health-care-defensive/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Claire McCaskill": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/politics/islam-claire-mccaskill-radio-ad/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate", "text": "Washington (CNN) There are two months until the midterm elections in November and Democrats still have a narrow path to the Senate majority despite a map that favors Republicans and includes 10 Democratic incumbents running in states President Donald Trump won, five of them by double-digit margins.\n\nThe President carried Indiana and Missouri by 19 points each, but a pair of new polls released this week by NBC News/Marist show Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill waging competitive re-election fights. In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party. But if a blue wave crests higher than expected, it could lift Democrats in states that would be all but lost in a more neutral environment.\n\nDemocrats are on offense in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton carried by 2 points and where Rep. Jacky Rosen is now challenging GOP Sen. Dean Heller. The Battle Born State could be ground zero for the health care debate this cycle, with Rosen aggressively attacking Heller's support for the GOP's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublicans breathed a sigh of relief late last month when GOP Rep. Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/09/politics/cnn-key-races-senate-update-early-september/index.html", "published": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive", "text": "In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor's race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches.\n\nAs a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation's health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law -- which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- are on the defensive.\n\nFor many GOP candidates, it's the first time they've been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions.\n\nThe American public has swung drastically in Democrats' favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far -- but now, that's down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it's either about right (21%) or didn't go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money.\n\nSeizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nThe pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning -- insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they'd do that.\n\nEven Republicans who haven't voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care.\n\nIn Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years.\n\nBut a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans.\n\nWhat Braun doesn't say in his ads: His company's insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun's auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.\n\nThe average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.\n\n\"Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,\" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.\n\nAnd Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.\n\n\"While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.\n\nOne of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.\n\nCruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \"every single word\" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.\n\nNow, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.\n\n\"You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,\" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.\n\nCruz touted his \"Consumer Freedom Amendment,\" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.\n\nHis Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: \"I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.\n\nIn the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \"rare chronic disease\" earlier this year -- \"a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.\"\n\n\"I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\" Hawley says in the ad.\n\nWanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018\n\nHowever, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional.

Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.\n\nHowever, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.\n\nRepublicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.\n\nIn hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.\n\nIn at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.\n\nThe Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \"DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer \"Medicare for all,\" saying that Gillum is running on a plan \"that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\"\n\nBut, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.\n\nIn Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.\n\nRosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were \"LIES!!!\" and that he is \"going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/politics/republicans-health-care-defensive/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Josh Hawley": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/politics/cnn-polls-missouri-nevada-senate/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate", "text": "Washington (CNN) There are two months until the midterm elections in November and Democrats still have a narrow path to the Senate majority despite a map that favors Republicans and includes 10 Democratic incumbents running in states President Donald Trump won, five of them by double-digit margins.\n\nThe President carried Indiana and Missouri by 19 points each, but a pair of new polls released this week by NBC News/Marist show Democratic Sens.

In a two-way contest, Donnelly leads Republican Mike Braun 49% to 43% in the Hoosier State, while McCaskill and Josh Hawley are locked in a dead heat -- each with 47% -- in the Show Me State.\n\nAnother prime target for Republicans is Florida, where Quinnipiac University found Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott running even with 49% each after some $37 million in television ads -- roughly half of that by Scott's campaign.\n\nThe Blue Wall of Great Lakes states that Trump toppled in November 2016 so far looks to be holding for Democrats in 2018. Sens. Bob Casey (Pennsylvania), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) and Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) are all favorites for re-election. Of that group, Baldwin appears to have the toughest race, facing a challenge from conservative state Sen. Leah Vukmir.\n\nTo be sure, the deep red states where Democratic incumbents are hoping to hang on may play to type and keep the majority out of reach for the party.

Martha McSally emerged from a tough primary contest in Arizona with a convincing victory against conservative firebrands Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio. But McSally's shift to the right during the nominating fight, particularly on immigration, could pose a challenge in the general against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who entered the general election largely unscathed.\n\nThe list of Democratic targets this cycle has doubled, with a pair of red states -- Tennessee and Texas -- looking increasingly competitive. With the Senate currently split 51-49 in favor of Republicans, if Democrats were able to win either of those contests -- assuming they also flip Arizona and Nevada -- it would mean the party could afford to see one of its incumbents defeated and still preserve a path to the majority.\n\nTennessee Senate: Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up\n\nIn Tennessee, former two-term Gov. Phil Bredesen is running a methodical campaign against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn by focusing on local issues and emphasizing his own moderate brand of politics over that of the national Democratic Party. That strategy seems to be working to his point, with an NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday showing Bredesen and Blackburn running neck and neck -- 48% to 46% -- among likely voters.\n\nBredesen's standing is buoyed by his popularity -- 61% of likely voters have a favorable view of the Democrat versus 22% who hold a negative view of him. By comparison, 46% of likely voters view Blackburn favorably compared with 36% who do not.\n\nWhen it comes to the President, 47% approve of his job performance while 43% disapprove. Blackburn, a staunch ally of the President, is making the argument that electing Bredesen could give Democrats control of the Senate -- a persuasive message in a state that went for Trump by 26 points. Bredesen has pledged to work with the President when he proposes policies that benefit Tennessee, declaring at the start of his campaign he was not \"running against\" Trump.\n\nTexas Senate: Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican\n\nRepublicans are sending the cavalry to Texas for Sen. Ted Cruz, with the President announcing he'll do an October rally for his former 2016 GOP primary rival, and the political arm of the Club for Growth launching a seven-figure television ad campaign to hammer Cruz's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke has been a fundraising phenom, more than doubling Cruz in the second quarter and leading the GOP incumbent in cash on hand by almost $5 million. Polls show O'Rourke within striking distance of Cruz. The latest NBC News/Marist survey showed the race at 49% to 45% in Cruz's favor.\n\nFor Democrats, the path to victory in the Lone Star State has been elusive. The party's last statewide win came in 1994. The last time Texas elected a Democrat to the Senate was 1988. Clinton lost the state by nine points -- an improvement on Mitt Romney's 16-point margin over Barack Obama in 2012. Having tapped into the Democrats' enthusiasm edge, O'Rourke appears poised to narrow the gap even more this year.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nWest Virginia should be at or near the top of the GOP's targets this cycle based on Trump's 42-point margin there in 2016. The President has also visited the Mountaineer State six times since taking office.\n\nThe difficulty for Republicans is they are running against Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a popular two-term governor who has demonstrated a willingness to buck his party and support the President's policies and nominees. He voted for Trump's first Supreme Court selection, Neil Gorsuch, and has signaled he's open to supporting Brett Kavanaugh, saying Wednesday he has not seen anything disqualifying from the nominee during this week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Manchin also has demonstrated he can win in a less-than-ideal environment, receiving 61% of the vote in 2012 even as Romney carried the state with 62% support.\n\nRepublican nominee Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general, has faced questions about his fundraising ability and Manchin has a six-to-one cash advantage. Morrisey only recently launched his first television ad, a biographical spot that features praise from the President and highlights his legal challenge to environmental regulations implemented by the Obama administration.\n\nThat comes after Democratic outside groups have spent the summer pummeling Morrisey on TV over his work as a \"DC lobbyist\" for pharmaceutical companies and his decision to join a lawsuit challenging the ACA, a move that could lead to protections for pre-existing conditions being struck down. That line of attack could resonate in West Virginia, which at 36% has the highest rate of adults under 65 with pre-existing conditions, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2016.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate: Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean Republican\n\nOne state where Republicans are increasingly bullish about their chances is North Dakota, where GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in a state the President carried by 36 points. Trump was personally involved in the effort to recruit Cramer into the race and stumped for the three-term GOP lawmaker Friday night in Fargo.\n\nFor a while it appeared Heitkamp was Trump's favorite Senate Democrat. The President praised her as a \"good woman\" during a September 2017 event in the Peace Garden State and invited her to the White House in May for the signing of a bank deregulation bill she co-sponsored.\n\nNow it seems the President is all-in for Cramer. \"You need a senator who doesn't just talk like they're from North Dakota, but votes like they're from North Dakota. That's what you need, and that's Kevin Cramer,\" Trump said during a Fargo rally in late June.\n\nHeitkamp should be able to keep the race close because of her strong personal brand and resource advantage -- leading Cramer $5.2 to $2.4 million in cash on hand. Cramer's bottom line should get a boost thanks to the President's visit, which his campaign says raised over $1 million.\n\nDemocrats are attacking Cramer on health care, accusing him of voting to strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and trade policy, a particularly acute concern in agriculture-rich North Dakota. Republicans, meanwhile, are targeting Heitkamp on hot-button issues such as abortion and so-called sanctuary cities, as well as her vote against the GOP tax cuts.\n\nGiven Trump's popularity in the state, Cramer's unwavering support for the President could be a more potent pitch to voters than Heitkamp's message of moderation. The national environment this year favors Democrats, but North Dakota is very much Trump country -- and Cramer is Trump's candidate.\n\nNew Jersey Senate: Race moves from Solid Democratic to Likely Democratic\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since New Jersey voters elected a Republican to the Senate.\n\nBob Hugin is a longshot to break that streak, but the pharmaceutical executive is giving Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez a serious challenge in the Garden State. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Hugin trailing Menendez by six points in a state Clinton won by 14 points in 2016 and Obama carried by 17 points four years earlier.\n\nThe federal corruption trial involving Menendez ended last November in a mistrial, but an ethical cloud continues to hang over the Democrat. Nearly half of New Jersey voters say Menendez was involved in serious wrongdoing, including 38% of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic primary voters in the state delivered a clear message to Menendez in June when little-known challenger Lisa McCormick drew 38% of the vote against the two-term incumbent. Still, Menendez received more votes than were cast in the GOP primary, which Hugin won with 75% support.\n\nHugin has loaned his campaign more than $15 million and has spent more than $7 million on television ads to boost his candidacy. Menendez has been saving his resources -- holding about $6.4 million cash on hand. He's also getting a little help from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recently teamed with Menendez on a joint television ad buy. Democrats feel confident Menendez's numbers will improve once he hits the airwaves. He also stands to benefit from several competitive House races in a state where Democrats have strong recruits.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/09/politics/cnn-key-races-senate-update-early-september/index.html", "published": "2018-09-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive", "text": "In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor's race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches.\n\nAs a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation's health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law -- which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions -- are on the defensive.\n\nFor many GOP candidates, it's the first time they've been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions.\n\nThe American public has swung drastically in Democrats' favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far -- but now, that's down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it's either about right (21%) or didn't go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money.\n\nSeizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nThe pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning -- insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they'd do that.\n\nEven Republicans who haven't voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care.\n\nIn Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years.\n\nBut a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans.\n\nWhat Braun doesn't say in his ads: His company's insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun's auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans' chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans' attacks on Obamacare.\n\nThe average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun's company's workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer's employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that's about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Donnelly's campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun's argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs.\n\n\"Even his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a 'solution' if they're as wealthy as he is,\" Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said.\n\nAnd Braun's campaign answered questions about his company's health care plan with an attack on Donnelly.\n\n\"While Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly's watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\" said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley.\n\nOne of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz -- the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party's wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- is now defending one of its core elements.\n\nCruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \"every single word\" of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward.\n\nNow, he says, there's one part of Obamacare he wouldn't roll back.\n\n\"You need to understand, everyone agrees we're going to protect pre-existing conditions,\" Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week.\n\nCruz touted his \"Consumer Freedom Amendment,\" introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don't meet Obamacare's requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law's requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz's proposal.\n\nHis Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, said: \"I don't know how you're going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nIn Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley -- who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill -- attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week.\n\nIn the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \"rare chronic disease\" earlier this year -- \"a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like.\"\n\n\"I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\" Hawley says in the ad.\n\nWanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 24, 2018\n\nHowever, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law.\n\nIf they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare's mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"Nerve,\" McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley's ad. \"He sues to wipe out the protection then 'goes to camera' to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.\"\n\nAnd this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then \"goes to camera\" to say he doesn't mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d \u2014 Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 25, 2018\n\nIn a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller -- the most vulnerable GOP senator this year -- and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place.\n\nHowever, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions -- or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn't stopped Heller's Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort.\n\nRepublicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage.\n\nIn hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November's midterm elections approach.\n\nIn at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They've used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful.\n\nThe Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits -- like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama's signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAnd they've focused on years' worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \"DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\" DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum's calls for single-payer \"Medicare for all,\" saying that Gillum is running on a plan \"that would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\"\n\nBut, like in Indiana, Democrats haven't needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point.\n\nIn Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies' plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner.\n\nRosendale responded by tweeting that the Tester camp's claims were \"LIES!!!\" and that he is \"going to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions and deliver health care WE CAN ALL AFFORD!!!\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/politics/republicans-health-care-defensive/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}]}}}
