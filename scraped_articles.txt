But they are stopping short of issuing direct threats of repercussions, according to the Times.\n\nThe limited operation is designed to scare the operatives to prevent election interference without provoking a reprisal from the Russian government that could escalate the situation, such as a cyber-attack on the power grid.\n\nThe American cyber campaign, waged by a component of the Department of Defense, is the first known international cyber operation designed to protect American elections. The next national races in the U.S. will take place November 6.\n\nWhile the operation is seeking to deter disinformation efforts, it is not clear if it is aimed at more overt cybercrimes, like hacking.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Russians accused of using several tactics to interfere in American elections, ranging from provocative posts on social media from fake accounts to hacking into the servers owned by the Democratic National Committee. The U.S. intelligence committee says there is no evidence that individual votes were altered due to hacking of election machines.\n\nThe defense officials who disclosed the current operation to the Times did not provide details about how the Cyber Command is contacting the Russians it is tracking, or how many individuals it has targeted.\n\nOther officials, according to the newspaper, said that the operation was targeting suspected computer criminals working for organizations funded by wealthy Russians as well as those employed by the country's intelligence services.\n\nThe Cyber Command did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials have grown increasingly worried about foreign efforts to sow discord in U.S. elections following an assessment from the intelligence community that concluded that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe Justice Department has obtained indictments against dozens of Russian nationals, and a number of Russian organizations, accusing them of crimes related to election interference. No verdict has been reached in any of those cases.\n\nLast month, John Bolton, the National Security Advisor, said that the White House had loosened up Obama-era restrictions on American cyber capabilities. In August, Trump signed a secretive order that apparently reversed a number of those restrictions and granted the government more leeway to go on the offense. The White House has also delegated more power to Gen. Paul Nakasone, who took over the Cyber Command in May.\n\nOn Friday, the DOJ brought its first case related to election interference in the upcoming midterms. The government accused Elena Khusyaynova of St. Petersburg, Russia, of participating in a conspiracy engaged in \"information warfare against the United States\" that aimed \"create and amplify divisive social media and political content.\"\n\nProsectors claim Khusyaynova is the chief accountant for a Russian company backed by the oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin, also known as \"Putin's chef,\" and two companies that he controls. Those companies were named in a previous indictment obtained by the Justice Department.\n\nIn Congress, oversight of American efforts to rebuff Russian meddling has been led by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe chair of that committee, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and its vice chair, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., declined on Tuesday to confirm that the Cyber Command operation existed. But Warner said in a statement that the U.S. needs \"an effective strategy to counter cyberattacks and influence campaigns conducted by other countries.\"\n\n\"If carried out in the right way, raising the costs for countries, companies, or individuals who conduct such attacks would certainly fit into such a strategy,\" he said.\n\nRead the full story at The New York Times.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/23/us-warning-individual-russians-over-midterm-election-interference.html", "published": "2018-10-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Mississippi Senate election could go to a runoff: NBC", "text": "A Senate special election in red Mississippi could head to a runoff in late November as Democrat Mike Espy pushes to upset Republican Sen.

Chris McDaniel, the NBC News/Marist poll released Tuesday found. Another 15 percent of likely voters are undecided, while nonpartisan candidate Tobey Bartee takes 2 percent of support.\n\nIf no candidate gets 50 percent, the contest would move to a Nov. 27 runoff. That potential race favors Hyde-Smith as she consolidates Republican voters, according to the survey. She garners 50 percent of support among likely voters while Espy gets 36 percent and 13 percent are undecided.\n\nEspy appears to have a better chance if McDaniel finds his way into a runoff. In a potential matchup between the two men, the Democrat has a 7 percentage point edge, according to the survey.\n\nHyde-Smith was appointed to fill the Senate seat after longtime GOP Sen. Thad Cochran retired earlier this year due to health issues.

But of course, many are sure to explain, they will divert serious cash to charity after winning what lottery officials call the biggest lottery jackpot in history.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Mega Millions drawing will pay out at least $1.6 billion to winning jackpot ticket holders, if there are any, after Friday\u2019s already record-setting drawing ended with no ticket matching all six numbers. That number is \u201cuncharted territory\u201d for Mega Millions, lottery officials said.\n\nAnd the chances are rising that a winner or winners will emerge after the numbers are called.\n\nBy then, lottery officials estimate 75 percent of all number combinations will be purchased by Tuesday morning, Maryland Lottery and Gaming spokeswoman Carole Gentry told The Washington Post. There are 302,575,350 possible combinations \u2014 which are the odds of winning.\n\nThat fever has struck nationwide. The Virginia Lottery projects sales after Friday\u2019s drawing through Tuesday\u2019s drawing will approach $19 million, lottery spokeswoman Jennifer Mullen said. In the sales peak, as many as 12,700 tickets will be sold per minute, Mullen said.\n\nOn Thursday, ahead of the last drawing, California residents were buying 200 tickets a second, the Associated Press reported.\n\nWhat\u2019s my payout if I win?\n\nThe estimated cash option is about $905 million should a winner choose to take a one-time lump sum payment instead of annual payouts over 30 years, according to Mega Millions officials.\n\nBut that\u2019s before taxes. You\u2019d get about half of that after state and federal taxes take a big bite of your winnings, the AP reported. The annual payouts would net a higher payout over time, but you would have to squirrel away enough money to buy, say, a struggling NFL team.\n\nIs it me, or are lottery jackpots huge these days?\n\nIt\u2019s not just you. Lottery officials count on enormous jackpots to draw in players who would ordinarily avoid participating, so last October they made two big changes. They doubled ticket prices to $2 \u2014 and tweaked the formula to make it easier to win smaller prizes but harder to win the jackpot.\n\nHere\u2019s how Mega Millions used to work: Players picked five numbers from 1 to 75 and a Mega number from 1 to 15. The odds of winning the top prize were 1 in 258,890,850.\n\nSince Mega Millions modified the formula, players now pick five numbers from 1 to 70 and a Mega number of 1 to 25. The odds of winning the jackpot are now 1 in 302,575,350.\n\nIn other words, reducing the number of balls for the first five numbers increases the chances of winning a smaller prize. But raising the number of Mega Balls makes it harder to win the jackpot. (You still win the big jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.)\n\nPowerball made similar changes to its rules in 2015. That game itself is currently at a monster jackpot, though a small one relative to Mega Millions, at $620 million ahead of Wednesday\u2019s drawing.\n\nDo people think they\u2019re going to win?\n\nThey do.\n\n\u201cI believe I already won,\u201d Joseph Rauch told Reuters, \u201cbelieve I believe in the law of attraction. So what\u2019s meant to be is already gonna be.\u201d\n\nOthers are already self-read experts on how to deal with such an enormous and public prize. \u201cI would incorporate myself as a business and become my own company,\u201d Gregory Baron said in New York City.\n\nAnd even apparent fatalists are wandering to the corner store for a shot at the jackpot.\n\nHank Kattan is 75 years old.

Beaten the odds \u2014 one in 302,575,350 \u2014 and won the largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. lottery history. Perhaps you\u2019re splitting the $1.6 billion grand prize with another winning ticket or two. Either way, you\u2019re almost certainly about to enjoy an astronomical spike in wealth.\n\nNow what?\n\nBefore you shout from the rooftops or broadcast your excitement on social media, take a deep breath and keep some practical advice in mind.\n\nTo sign or not to sign the back of the lottery ticket?\n\nThere are plenty of people who will advise you to sign the back of the lottery ticket right away. After all, what would happen if, heaven forbid, you lost the ticket? Or worse yet, if an unscrupulous person in your life took the unsigned ticket and claimed it as his or hers?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nSome states require lottery winners to be publicly identified, while in others, they can remain anonymous if they claim the prize through an anonymous trust or a limited liability company (more on that later). However, signing the back of the lottery ticket with your real name may bind you to claiming the prize under that name, thus releasing your identity to the public even if that\u2019s not what you want.\n\n[He returned the orange juice to save money \u2014 and picked up a winning $315 million lottery ticket]\n\nEarlier this year, a New Hampshire woman who won a $560 million Powerball jackpot found herself in just such a predicament: She wanted to claim the prize under an anonymous trust but had already signed the back of her ticket with her real name.\n\nA judge eventually ruled she could keep the money and her privacy but, as The Washington Post\u2019s Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reported, she lost about $14,000 in interest every day the case remained unresolved.\n\nWhat may be more advisable is keeping the ticket in a secure place, such as a safe, while you consult with an attorney.\n\nThat way, if you decide to create a trust or an LLC through which to claim your prize, you can sign the back of the ticket with the name of those entities instead.\n\nSpeaking of attorneys ...\n\n\u201cThe three phone calls I would make: lawyer, accountant, financial adviser,\u201d said Randy Zelin, a New York-based litigation attorney.\n\nA lawyer who specializes in trusts and estate planning would be ideal, but the most important thing to remember is that your privacy is paramount, Zelin said this week.\n\nA few years ago, Zelin cringed as he watched another attorney parade his clients \u2014 a Tennessee family that had won a $500 million Powerball jackpot \u2014 onto the \u201cToday\u201d show to announce their winnings.\n\n\u201cThat goes down in the annals of 'What exactly were you thinking?\u2019\u201d Zelin told CNN at the time.\n\nAn attorney can help you navigate what you are obligated to divulge under the terms and conditions of your ticket and your state\u2019s public disclosure laws.\n\n\u201cYou want to discuss everything from the vehicle that you\u2019re going to use for the money to go to, how to handle the publicity, understanding what your rights are and your obligations are in terms of making yourself available and the use of your likeness,\u201d Zelin told The Post.\n\nThese may seem like unnecessary precautions now, but lottery winners are famously susceptible to becoming targets for everything from extortion to blackmail to even kidnapping.\n\nThere will certainly be people who approach you for handouts if your name is public.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need every family member you never heard of coming out of the woodwork,\u201d Zelin said. \u201cYou want to be as low-key and have this money lawyered and away from prying eyes as you possibly can. Just about the last thing you want to do is be public when you win.\u201d\n\nFind a good accountant and financial adviser, too\n\nMega Millions allows jackpot winners to claim the grand prize either through a onetime lump-sum cash payment or through annual payments over 30 years. In the case of Tuesday\u2019s big prize, the lump-sum cash option will be an estimated $905 million, while the annuity payments would, eventually, amount to $1.6 billion.\n\nA reliable accountant can ensure you understand the tax consequences in your state for both options. The website USAMega.com breaks down what your winnings could look like after taxes for your state.\n\n[She bought her first lottery ticket on her 18th birthday \u2014 and now she\u2019s set for life]\n\nThe benefit of the smaller lump sum, of course, is that you get more money right away. That can also be a drawback for people who are not used to wealth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently different about lottery winnings than it is about other kinds of wealth that\u2019s created,\u201d said Michael S. Arlein, a trust and estate planning lawyer. \u201cBut I think often lottery winners don\u2019t come from money, and so they instantaneously have to deal with money. One day they have none, and the next day they have a huge amount. So I think there\u2019s probably a learning curve that exists for lottery winners that doesn\u2019t exist for people who made their money over a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019ve decided whether you want to take the lump sum, a financial adviser can help ensure it\u2019s managed and invested wisely.\n\nAs The Post has reported, there are countless stories of people whose lottery winnings have vanished almost as quickly as they won it.\n\nOther lottery winners have realized that every ticket buyer\u2019s fantasy can quickly morph into a nightmare. There are myriad self-inflicted problems that can befall a person who suddenly comes into great wealth. One bought a water park, for example. Several others have gambled their winnings away, including a two-time lottery winner who ended up living in a trailer. Billie Bob Harrell Jr., who won $31 million in 1997, told his financial adviser shortly before his suicide that \u201cwinning the lottery is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many stories have we heard?\u201d Zelin said. \u201cYou\u2019re now a pi\u00f1ata if you allow yourself to be. You really need to be very smart.\u201d\n\nThe number one thing to try to hold onto is patience.\n\nMega Millions winners have between 180 days to one year from the date of the drawing to claim their prize, depending on the state in which the winning tickets were purchased.\n\nThat should allow ample time to hire a lawyer, create a trust if necessary and prepare, prepare, prepare.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything too quickly. You have time,\u201d Zelin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to make any sudden moves, and you want to be very smart about the way you handle it because things happen at about 400 miles an hour and you want to be prepared for it. There\u2019s no substitute for preparation.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA hospital worker won the Powerball.

Another claimed her co-worker had assaulted her. The third petitioner accused a police chief of raping her several times while she was volunteering in his department. And the fourth, now 30, said she was assaulted by a massage therapist.\n\nAll four cases were reviewed by the local prosecutor\u2019s office, which declined to file charges.\n\nNow the four Utah residents are using a novel approach to make their voices heard: a provision in the state\u2019s constitution that permits alleged crime victims to request that the state Supreme Court appoint a prosecutor if a district attorney refuses a case.\n\nThe constitutional clause is unique to Utah, but the concept of victim-initiated prosecution is available in other states.\n\nAttorneys for the women are optimistic that if they succeed in Salt Lake County, the ruling will create a viable blueprint for other states.\n\nSalt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill called the petition an \u201cintriguing thing that\u2019s never been challenged.\u201d Still, Gill joins a number of lawyers who worry that a successful lawsuit will pave the way for thousands of frivolous petitions in many types of cases.\n\nIn the past two years, all four women \u2014 known in their recently filed lawsuit as \u201cthe Jane Does\u201d \u2014 said they were attacked by someone they knew and reported the assault within days.\n\nJane Doe 1, now 18, told The Washington Post that she hopes to help other victims be heard.\n\nAfter the Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute the case, the teenager\u2019s high school allowed her alleged rapist back on campus.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel so vulnerable and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think the law will protect those who have been wronged. I don\u2019t want another girl going through this again. I want to make it easier to get help and to have the law believe you.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is the first time in Utah\u2019s 120-year history that anyone has approached the issue this way, Paul Cassell, a former federal judge and professor at the University of Utah\u2019s S.J. Quinney College of Law, told The Post.\n\nHistorically, the nation rarely questions a law enforcement decision to decline bringing charges. \u201cThe sexual assault under-prosecution problem is forcing people to reevaluate that,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of requesting sweeping interference with law enforcement decisions, the lawsuit asks for a specific ruling on a case that has been turned down for prosecution.\n\n[Police in many states could legally have sex with a person in custody \u2014 until a N.Y. rape allegation]\n\nThe suit comes amid heated national dialogue about sexual abuse, as the #MeToo movement has emboldened more women to speak out. It was further fueled by the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, which were shadowed by outrage over decades-old allegations of sexual assault.\n\nThe consensus, according to attorney Bethany Warr, who represents three of the Jane Does, is that sexual assault cases are under-prosecuted, though there are places where it\u2019s more pronounced than others.\n\n\u201cThey have a tendency to be declined by district attorneys, and fairly so \u2014 they\u2019re difficult cases,\u201d Warr said. The lawsuit aims to further the dialogue about why juries are so hard on sex-crime victims and why society has such a hard time believing them, she said.\n\nSex-crime prosecutions are widely accepted as some of the most challenging in the criminal justice system.\n\nSexual assaults rarely happen with other witnesses present, and anything that deviates from the cliche of a masked, armed man committing a rape in an alleyway adds a variable that must be explained to frequently judgmental juries.\n\nIn Salt Lake County, Cassell said, assistant district attorneys operate under outdated notions of what cases are winnable, saying that prosecutors who are fearful of losing are the real barrier to successful prosecutions.\n\nGill, who is up for reelection this year, agreed that these are difficult cases for prosecutors. But, he said, that doesn\u2019t mean his office refuses to prosecute them.\n\nAn average of 44 percent of violent crimes are reported to law enforcement and result in arrest, according to a statement released by Gill on Tuesday. Sexual crimes, he said, vary dramatically.\n\nIn Utah, 12 percent are brought forward \u2014 meaning 88 of 100 people fail to report sexual assault claims, Gill told The Post. He also said that last year, his office filed charges in 39 to 40 percent of 600 sexual assault reports, consistent with the national average.\n\nGill said there\u2019s a social stigma associated with sexual assault, and because only a small percentage are reported, a systemic attrition happens.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure out what the balance is \u2014 to reassure victims that we see and hear them, while asking if the interests of justice will be met by bringing the case forward. Can we meet the legal burden in good faith?\u201d\n\nGill pointed out that sexual assault cases have nuanced complexity. One major consideration, he said, is whether to re-traumatize a victim by having her testify in a case that would be challenging to win.\n\nDeborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Law and a former prosecutor, said, \u201cThe problem with prosecutors is that they\u2019re not just thinking about legal sufficiency, they\u2019re thinking about convictability\u201d \u2014 the likelihood that 12 jurors can be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cOften, jurors are unpersuaded because of biases and rape myths. When prosecutors take that into account in charging decisions, even anticipatorily, they\u2019re embedding them into the system.\u201d\n\nThe #MeToo movement heightened awareness of the prevalence of sexual assault. Part of the benefit is that people better understand what sexual violence looks like, which mitigates assumptions about the type of person who perpetrates these crimes and how a survivor \u201cshould\u201d behave, Tuerkheimer said.\n\nThe petitioners remain hopeful that the Utah Supreme Court, which has the petition under advisement, will direct the attorney general\u2019s office and other government agencies to file briefs in response.\n\nEach of the Jane Does wants to fight for the right to hold her alleged abuser accountable. Jane Doe 4 told the Salt Lake Tribune: \u201cI did everything that I needed to do and I did it as strongly as I could,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how disappointing and heartbreaking it would be.\u201d\n\nBy putting their stories into circulation, they hope to challenge old injustices and forge change within the criminal justice system.\n\nRead more:\n\nFormer state GOP official warns Trump protesters: Montana is an \u2018open carry state\u2019\n\nA black child\u2019s backpack brushed up against a woman.

Have seen hundreds of women and children and babies, though. https://t.co/skzF0IEGCi \u2014 Kate Linthicum (@katelinthicum) October 22, 2018\n\nThe Washington Post, CNN, the Associated Press and many other mainstream outlets have covered the migrants' journey with considerably less foreboding, just as they did a smaller caravan that petered out before it reached the U.S. border earlier this year.\n\nAmong the 5,000 or so people who crossed the Guatemalan border into southern Mexico this weekend, Kevin Sieff reported for The Post, are a call center worker who grew up in the United States and wants to return; a wood-flooring installer who was deported from Phoenix six months ago and still has a 6-year-old son there; and uncounted families fleeing poverty or organized violence in their home countries.\n\nThey travel together for safety as they cross regions controlled by gangs and drug cartels. Most of them hope to seek asylum at the border or \u2014 more likely \u2014 to try to cross into the United States illegally.\n\nSo despite the caravan\u2019s size, it\u2019s no different in purpose than smaller mass migrations that routinely cross Central America.\n\nThe last one passed through last spring, drawing its own entourage of reporters and outraged tweets from Trump. It grew to about 1,000 people, which, it turned out, was too large for purposes of logistics, and so the caravan disbanded in Mexico City long before it reached the U.S. border.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how a group at least five times larger \u2014 apparently reliant on food and water from passersby \u2014 hopes to make it any farther.\n\nThat context was not in Monday\u2019s Fox News alert.\n\nSome of it came across later in the episode \u2014 perhaps unintentionally \u2014 when Doocy brought out a panel of four people identified as independent voters and asked about the caravan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s north of apparently 7,000 people strong,\u201d Doocy told the first independent voter, Michael Willner. \u201cHow big a problem is that, that the United States has uneven immigration laws?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think uneven immigration laws are a problem for any country, and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated,\u201d Willner said.\n\n[\u2018He chose to blow it\u2019: A rare dissent from the couch of \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 after Trump attacks Ford]\n\n\u201cBut this country is founded on immigration,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd all of us come from immigrants.\u201d\n\nDoocy tried again.\n\n\u201cBy the time it gets here, it could be 10,000. It could be 20,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat should the United States do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the mightiest country on the planet,\u201d Willner replied. \u201cI think we can handle a caravan of people, unarmed, coming to this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Doocy said, pointing to the second independent voter. \u201cCathy: real quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the immigration crisis we\u2019re seeing is a result of the failure of the two democratic parties to actually engage the issue,\u201d said Cathy Stewart, with the New York Independence Party.\n\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d said Doocy.\n\n\u201cInstead, they use it like a partisan football,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Doocy. And, moving on: \u201cJohn, real quick.\u201d\n\nBut John Opdyke continued the previous independent voters' line of thought.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a humanitarian crisis taking place in Central America, and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s very little honest discussion about what\u2019s actually happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Aaron?\u201d Doocy said. His voice had fallen to something like a raspy whisper.\n\n\u201cTreating this as an \u2018invasion\u2019 is a bad idea, and it\u2019s going to end horribly if it is treated such as that way,\u201d said Aaron Commey, a libertarian and the final independent voter on the panel.\n\nDoocy collected his notes and sat up on his stool.\n\n\u201cSure, but the backdrop is the midterms, so it all becomes political,\u201d he told the voters. \u201cSo let\u2019s see what happens!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Fox & Friends dispensed with Monday\u2019s migrant news alert and moved on to the subject of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe next episode airs Tuesday morning. Perhaps another Fox News alert will pop up then, too.\n\nRead more:\n\nNavigating the border: The barriers that define the U.S.-Mexico borderline", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/fox-friends-voter-panel-rebels-when-asked-about-migrant-caravan/?utm_term=.0c9b51e623e6", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_politics": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/politics", "articles": [{"title": "The 2018 Trump factor: It's all about him", "text": "Houston (CNN) President Donald Trump knows the November election is all about him. He worries his supporters do not.\n\n\"Pretend I'm on the ballot,\" he says at most every rally, trying to awaken his supporters to the urgency of the fight for control of Congress.\n\nTwo weeks before Election Day, a new air of uncertainty hangs over the 2018 campaign that revolves almost entirely around the Trump factor.\n\nA month ago, the President seemed all but resigned that Republicans would lose the House, two people who speak to him frequently tell CNN. But his outlook has brightened in recent days, increasingly insisting he can awaken his coalition to stop -- or slow -- a Democratic wave, they say.\n\n\"If anyone can save the House, he thinks he can,\" a Republican congressman close to the President said. \"He's the only one who believes it's really possible.\"\n\nWhile most presidents distance themselves from midterm elections to avoid nationalizing the races, Trump is doing the opposite. He's all in, firing up loyal supporters and fierce critics alike.\n\n\"This will be the election of the caravan, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts and common sense,\" the President said to booming applause inside Houston's Toyota Center on Monday, boiling down his closing argument for Republicans in one crisp sentence.\n\nHere in Houston, the rally on Monday night is his 29th of the year. It follows a familiar pattern of much of his 2018 campaign travel: visiting red states filled with Trump admirers, hoping to minimize political harm by energizing his detractors.\n\nBut even in Texas, several Republican strategists expressed a palpable level of anxiety at what the President might say during his unscripted rally. Trump's sharp rhetoric on immigration, two officials said, could awaken Hispanic voters or independents in key congressional races in the state.\n\n\"We were hoping he would go to West Texas for this rally,\" a Republican strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen criticizing the President or the White House.\n\nAn analysis of Trump's travel shows where he is -- and isn't -- welcome. In deep-red Montana, for example, he's staged three rallies to try to defeat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in a race even most Republicans see as no easy task.\n\nYet he's all but steering clear of Florida -- holding no big rallies so far this fall, despite campaigning there just months ago during the GOP primary. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who's locked in a tight race to unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, has asked Trump to stay away, a GOP official said.\n\nBut as in many states, Trump remains a central theme of the race, as illustrated in dueling TV ads from Nelson and Scott.\n\n\"When President Trump asks for something that's good for him and bad for Florida, I know what I'll do. I'll say no,\" Nelson said in a recent ad. \"And we all know what Rick Scott will do. He'll say yes.\"\n\nScott responded: \"I'll work with President Trump when he's doing things that are good for Florida and America. And when I disagree, I have the courage to say so.\"\n\nSo far, the President has agreed not to campaign in Florida, but he did visit the Gulf Coast this month to survey hurricane damage. A Republican official said Trump keeps asking about the race, saying he wants to do a rally in the final week for either the Senate or governor's race.\n\nThe last time Trump spent so much time hopscotching from one roaring arena to another, he was on a victory tour, thanking voters who helped turn states from blue to red in his triumph over Hillary Clinton. But statewide GOP candidates are trailing in most of those new Trump states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the near-nightly Trump show is back, this time his rallies are no longer regularly seen live on cable television. Even his beloved Fox News had taken a pass for weeks -- until Monday night, when the Houston rally aired from start to finish.\n\nHis devoted fans are still filling every arena to the brim, but White House aides said he has repeatedly expressed frustration that his speeches are not being televised.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that Trump isn't still the central character of the midterm election campaign.\n\nThe President appears in nearly 20% of all political ads this year, according to an analysis of data from Kantar Media/CMAG, based on the top 100 most competitive House and Senate races.\n\nSo far this year, at least $55 million has been spent on pro-Trump ads, the analysis found, with $61 million on anti-Trump ads.\n\nThe White House is increasingly confident about keeping control of the Senate, largely cause of the blessing of geography, with the majority of competitive seats in red states. To most places, Trump's message lingers far longer than he does because Republicans turn his rallies into 30-second commercials blasting the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"Phil whatever the hell his name is, this guy will 100% vote against us every single time,\" Trump says in an ad, attacking Phil Bredesen, the former Democratic governor running for the open Senate seat in Tennessee against Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nWhile Trump has said he will accept no blame if Republicans lose control of the House, he will have to deal with the consequences of a Democrat-controlled House investigating the White House.\n\nSuch talk has been all but suspended for now in the West Wing, two aides said, with the President not interested in discussing what happens beyond Election Day. He has previously told allies that Democrat-led impeachment or investigations could strengthen his hand going into 2020.\n\nWhatever the outcome on November 6, the midterm election campaign has solidified Trump as the indisputable leader of the Republican Party. Even old rivals like Cruz now depend on Trump's coalition for their own survival.\n\n\"I think it energizes people,\" Cruz told CNN on the eve of Trump's visit to Houston. \"I think it's going to help drive turnout. And this election is a turnout election.\"\n\nAsked whether Trump was the biggest factor, Cruz replied: \"The President is certainly a factor in the election, but I think the biggest factor in Texas is the economic boom we're seeing.\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/trump-factor-all-about-him/index.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump's midterm campaign of fear", "text": "(CNN) Donald Trump is waging one of the most inflammatory closing arguments of any modern campaign, lacing his midterm rhetoric with easily disprovable claims that are building on the fact-challenged foundation of his presidency.\n\nWith just two weeks to go before the midterm election, the President is doing what he does best, seizing national attention with a flood of outrageous and improbable lies that drown out rivals, leverage his brawling personality and rip at fault lines of race, identity and patriotism.\n\nAbove all, Trump is hardening his line on immigration, the explosive issue that is usually a winner for him, in a strategy designed to drive his loyalists to the polls to defy ominous midterm omens that haunt every first-term president.\n\nThere are signs the scorched-earth blitz is working as Trump's approval rating ticks up , offering Republicans the possibility of increasing their Senate majority and longer-shot hopes of clinging to their control of the House.\n\nBut Trump's gamble may not be universally successful. His clamorous approach could backfire in the more moderate suburban districts where the battle for the House will be decided and he ran behind Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAnd his strategy -- which is essentially a case of a President grabbing some of the most emotive, divisive political issues and demagoguing them in a fear-based campaign for his own benefit -- is likely to leave the nation more polarized and unable to reach solutions to its most pressing problems.\n\nThe President's midterm onslaught is playing out in rallies across the nation that mostly target conservative regions where he is most popular.\n\nHis latest stop was Texas, where he appeared alongside former GOP presidential primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday night.\n\n\"The Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country, the security of our nation and the safety of every American,\" Trump said, blaming Democrats for \"the crisis on our border.\"\n\nHis hardcore approach sometimes overshadows the story of success that the President has to tell and would be the top talking point for most presidents, including the lowest jobless rate in half a century, an economy that has thrived since he has been in office and the two conservative Supreme Court justices he has installed.\n\nIn his most extreme attack, Trump is accusing Democrats of organizing a migrant caravan trekking through Mexico that he says will lay siege to the US border. He has claimed without offering any evidence that the caravan includes criminals and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" Reporters walking with the caravan say it's made up of desperate Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing repression and poverty.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that there was \"absolutely\" evidence of Middle Easterners in the caravan -- but did not provide any.\n\nVehemence of rhetoric\n\nTrump is certainly not the first politician to distort the profiles and positions of his opponents or to suggest that their positions are un-American.\n\nBut the volume and vehemence of Trump's rhetoric, and his willingness to fling explosive claims even though they are demonstrably untrue is unlike any campaign in decades.\n\nIn Arizona, over the weekend for instance, a huge chunk of his speech was on immigration. Trump voters, many of whom believe politicians failed to do anything about what they see as undocumented migrants undercutting their wages and taking their jobs, see the President's rhetoric as legitimate. And they reject media critiques that the President lies and many see his unchained rhetoric as exactly the kind of anti-establishment behavior that made him an attractive candidate in the first place.\n\nThe television footage of people marching across Mexico plays directly into Trump's rhetorical law-and-order construct of a nation under siege from outside criminal elements -- no matter what the reality on the ground may be. Trump's claims are also relayed by conservative media.\n\n\"A Democratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker, smuggler, drug dealer and illegal alien on the planet. Come on in, folks,\" Trump said in Arizona.\n\n\"A Republican victory would send the message that America will enforce our borders and defend our citizens. It's important.\"\n\nTrump's tough approach has highlighted one of his most useful political assets that also makes him the most dangerous threat to the conventions of the political system in decades -- his lack of shame and willingness to make brazen arguments based on lies, which most presidents would avoid.\n\nHis energy and willingness to campaign like he is on the ballot may also be a factor.\n\n\"We've added a lot of spice to it, when I say we, maybe it's I, and others perhaps. They see that I am coming here,\" Trump said, in an interview with ABC 13 News in Houston.\n\nHow do Democrats respond?\n\nTrump's spiced up rhetoric has left Democrats facing questions about how to respond since they have no one on the national political stage with the star power of the President. Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday accused Trump of scaremongering over the border and a caravan that is still 1,000 miles away.\n\n\"He's making it sound like they're breaking through the border. This is hysteria on his part,\" Biden, a potential 2020 Democratic candidate, told CNN while campaigning in Florida.\n\nOn Saturday, the top two Democrats in Congress, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, argued that Trump's harsh turn was a sign of weakness rather than strength.\n\n\"The president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nIn some ways, Trump does not have many options but to go on such a rampage. He's built his presidency on keeping his base angry -- and in the process has alienated many more moderate voters. So only a presidential-election-level turnout from his base in a midterm election is likely to stave off big Democratic gains at a time when the opposition party is also enthusiastic.\n\nAnd he knows that immigration -- from the moment he stepped on the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to be a candidate -- is the issue that has helped him at the ballot box more than any other, despite political missteps like the separation of undocumented immigrant families and their children earlier this year.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump is President because of the immigration issue,\" Scott Jennings, a former campaign aide to Bush, told CNN on Monday.\n\n\"He wants to paint a line between a party that wants border security and a party that doesn't.\"\n\nBut former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook argued that the fragmented nature of the Senate and House races meant that Trump's immigration rhetoric represented a high-risk strategy.\n\n\"I don't think it is going to save them in these suburban areas that are so important for the House map or the gubernatorial map,\" Mook told CNN's Erica Hill.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/23/politics/donald-trump-mid-term-election-immigration-ted-cruz/index.html", "published": "2018-10-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump's making the migrant caravan a political issue. Here are the facts.", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump , in a series of tweets on Monday, claimed he would declare a \"national emergency\" over an issue that has frequently piqued his attention -- migrant caravans moving toward the United States through Central America and Mexico.\n\nHis tweets come just weeks ahead of the 2018 midterm elections and he has emphasized immigration as a key issue, without evidence accusing Democrats of pushing for overrun borders in what appears to be a naked fear campaign aimed at turning out his supporters. Immigration was a key issue in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nCrowds of migrants, estimated to be in the thousands on Monday, resumed their long journey north on Sunday into Mexico as part of a migrant caravan originating in Central America.\n\nCurrently migrants are at the Central Park Miguel Hidalgo in the center of Tapachula. Organizers plan for them to begin moving north, reaching the northern city of Huixtla, which is about 20 miles north, and resting there.\n\nThe President, in his tweets, also made several questionable claims concerning immigration and the caravan. Among them: that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" are \"mixed\" in with the caravan, that he would be cutting off foreign aid over the caravan, and that Mexican authorities failed to stop migrants from coming into Mexico.\n\nAsked later Monday about his assertion about \"unknown Middle Easterners\" in the caravan, Trump said: \"Unfortunately, they have a lot of everybody in that group.\"\n\n\"We've gotta stop them at the border and, unfortunately, you look at the countries, they have not done their job,\" he said. \"They have not done their job. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- they're paid a lot of money, every year we give them foreign aid and they did nothing for us, nothing.\"\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nAre there \"unknown Middle Easterners\" \"mixed\" into the migrant caravan?\n\nTrump tweeted \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed\" into the migrant caravan moving toward the United States. He called this a \"national emergy\" (sic).\n\nIt's unclear what \"unknown Middle Easterners\" Trump appears to be referring to in his tweet, since there have been no reports, in the press or publicly from intelligence agencies, to suggest there are \"Middle Easterners\" embedded in the caravan.\n\nA senior counterterrorism official told CNN's Jessica Schneider that \"while we acknowledge there are vulnerabilities at both our northern and southern border, we do not see any evidence that ISIS or other Sunni terrorist groups are trying to infiltrate the southern US border.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday afternoon that the administration \"absolutely\" has evidence of Middle Easterners in the caravan, \"and we know this is a continuing problem.\"\n\nHowever, she did not provide the specific evidence supporting that claim.\n\nDuring a White House conference call with surrogates regarding the caravan, a Homeland Security official said the administration is looking into a claim from Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales that his country has been able to capture around 100 terrorists. However, the official did not offer any evidence of the Middle Eastern people who Trump claims are hiding among migrants in the caravan.\n\n\"We are looking into that claim from the President Morales on the numbers,\" Jonathan Hoffman, the DHS official, said. \"It is not unusual to see people from Middle Eastern countries or other areas of the world pop up and attempt to cross our borders.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Morales claimed foreign individuals linked to terrorism were captured in the country during his administration, which began in January 2016.\n\n\"We have arrested almost 100 people highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS. We have not only detained them in our territory, they have also been deported to their countries of origin. All of you here have information to that effect,\" Morales said during a Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America event attended by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThere's no direct link or correlation between Morales' statement and Trump's assertion about the caravan on Twitter.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also did not provide any evidence to bolster the President's claim about \"unknown Middle Easterns\" in the caravan when asked for it by CNN on Monday.\n\nA department official told CNN that in fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border Protection \"apprehended 17,256 criminals, 1,019 gang members, and 3,028 special interest aliens from countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and Somalia. Additionally, (Customs and Border Protection) prevented 10 known or suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United States every day in fiscal year 2017.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not specify any Middle Eastern countries.\n\nPressed about the President's assertion that there are \"unknown Middle Easterners\" mixed in with the caravan, a State Department spokesperson said they understand there are several nationalities in the caravan and referred us to Department of Homeland Security for more information.\n\nWill the administration cut off foreign aid? Can they?\n\nTrump tweeted that because \"Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S.,\" the United States \"will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.\"\n\nIt's unclear where the administration will propose to make the cuts the President appears to be talking about, and CNN has reached out to the White House and the DHS for further information.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act prohibits the President from withholding -- or impounding -- money appropriated by Congress.\n\nNew York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said Monday that his office has reached out to the Government Accountability Office to ensure that the President does not violated the act.\n\n\"Fortunately, Congress -- not the President -- has the power of the purse, and my colleagues and I will not stand idly by as this Administration ignores congressional intent,\" Engel said in a statement.\n\nTrump has made the threat of cuts to foreign aid going to Latin American countries over migrant caravans several times over the last year.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, and with the approval of the Republican-controlled Congress, there have already been significant cuts to foreign aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries he mentioned Monday -- and the administration plans to continue making cuts in fiscal year 2019.\n\nWere authorities from Mexico unable to stop the migrant caravan from heading into the US?\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that \"Mexico's Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States.\"\n\nThere are some 7,500 people marching north as part of a migrant caravan through Mexico, caravan organizer Dennis Omar Contreras told CNN. He said the organizers did a count of participants Monday morning.\n\nHe said the migrants will leave Mexico's Tapachula for the town of Huixtla, which is located more than 20 miles northwest of their Monday morning location.\n\nWhile Mexican authorities said before the caravan's arrival that anyone who entered the country \"in an irregular manner\" could be subject to apprehension and deportation, many migrants from the caravan appear to have circumvented authorities.\n\nMexican authorities say more than 1,000 Central American migrants officially applied for refugee status in Mexico over the past three days.\n\nIt's unclear how authorities will respond to the thousands of other migrants who are marching north.\n\nWill the President declare a national emergency over the caravan?\n\nIt's unclear exactly what executive action, if any, the President will take following his tweet saying that he has \"alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National (emergency).\"\n\nPrevious administrations have ordered troops to the US southern border, and Trump issued a similar memorandum earlier this year ordering National Guard troops to be deployed to the US-Mexico border. The memo came around the same time another, smaller migrant caravan was moving toward the US through Central America.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told CNN that \"beyond the National Guard soldiers currently supporting the Department of Homeland Security on our southern border, in a Title 32, U.S. Code, section 502(f) duty status under the command and control of the respective State Governors, the Department of Defense has not been tasked to provide additional support at this time.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, referred questions about the national emergency to the White House, which did not answer to several questions for comment.\n\nDoris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and the former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, told CNN that the President's use of the term national emergency, and his potential subsequent declaration, is \"a subjective judgment.\"\n\n\"It is certainly true that the numbers that have been reported in this group are larger than anything that we've seen before this from these countries concentrated in one group,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she added that the reaction is \"disproportionate to what's happening.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it's not a genuine problem, but it's not like this is organized insurrection, in the way that its been characterized,\" she added.\n\nCNN's Catherine Shoichet, Sarah Westwood, Ryan Browne, Jennifer Hansler, Geneva Sands, Dakin Andone, Patrick Oppmann, Natalie Gall\u00f3n, Kevin Liptak and Jessica Schneider contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/donald-trump-migrant-caravan-fact-check/index.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Bill Nelson": {"link": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-andrew-gillum-bill-nelson-cnn-poll-20181022-story.html", "articles": [{"title": "Hear new episodes of the true-crime podcast Felonious Florida now", "text": "A stunning triple murder, a killer clown and mysterious text messages from a missing woman.\n\nThe hit podcast Felonious Florida is back with a second season featuring three new stories from the Dark Side of the Sunshine State.\n\nIn Episodes 1 and 2, investigative reporter Stephen Hobbs follows the case of a brutal 2009 triple murder.\n\nThe sole survivor had been shot in the head, and her inconsistent memories of the ordeal were making it difficult for detectives to find a suspect.

But can you visualize that pile of cash?\n\nLet\u2019s consider 1 billion, by the numbers.\n\nOne billion has nine zeros: 1,000,000,000 (a trillion has 12; a quadrillion has 15; a quintillion has 18). In mathematical terms, it\u2019s 109.\n\nOne billion = thousand million. (One million = thousand thousand.)\n\nA stack of 1 billion one-dollar bills measures nearly 68 miles high. That\u2019s about the distance from Miami to West Palm Beach. (A dollar is .0043 inches thick.)\n\nOne billion $1 bills weigh 10 tons. (That\u2019s 20,000 pounds.)\n\nThe United States has 585 billionaires, according to Forbes latest list. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the richest with $112 billion, give or take.)\n\nIf you laid a billion dollars from end to end, they would measure 96,900 miles. That enough to go around the world nearly four times. (A dollar bill measures 6.14 inches; the circumference of Earth is about 24,901 miles.)\n\nIf you had a billion seconds to live, you\u2019d have a lot of living to do: 32 years. (There\u2019s 86,400 seconds in a day, in case you want to check my math.)\n\nThe current federal deficit is $895 billion.\n\nIf you had to earn a billion dollars, and were paid a dollar a second, it would take 11,600 days to earn that much dough. You\u2019d be making $3,600 an hour.\n\nTo spend a billion bucks, you\u2019d have to spend $10 per second nonstop for 3.17 years. That\u2019s a lot of shopping.\n\nNow, you can\u2019t spend anything if you don\u2019t have a lottery ticket. Get to the store.

It follows a familiar pattern of much of his 2018 campaign travel: visiting red states filled with Trump admirers, hoping to minimize political harm by energizing his detractors.\n\nBut even in Texas, several Republican strategists expressed a palpable level of anxiety at what the President might say during his unscripted rally. Trump's sharp rhetoric on immigration, two officials said, could awaken Hispanic voters or independents in key congressional races in the state.\n\n\"We were hoping he would go to West Texas for this rally,\" a Republican strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen criticizing the President or the White House.\n\nAn analysis of Trump's travel shows where he is -- and isn't -- welcome. In deep-red Montana, for example, he's staged three rallies to try to defeat Democratic Sen.

Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who's locked in a tight race to unseat Democratic Sen.

I'll say no,\" Nelson said in a recent ad. \"And we all know what Rick Scott will do. He'll say yes.\"\n\nScott responded: \"I'll work with President Trump when he's doing things that are good for Florida and America. And when I disagree, I have the courage to say so.\"\n\nSo far, the President has agreed not to campaign in Florida, but he did visit the Gulf Coast this month to survey hurricane damage. A Republican official said Trump keeps asking about the race, saying he wants to do a rally in the final week for either the Senate or governor's race.\n\nThe last time Trump spent so much time hopscotching from one roaring arena to another, he was on a victory tour, thanking voters who helped turn states from blue to red in his triumph over Hillary Clinton. But statewide GOP candidates are trailing in most of those new Trump states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the near-nightly Trump show is back, this time his rallies are no longer regularly seen live on cable television. Even his beloved Fox News had taken a pass for weeks -- until Monday night, when the Houston rally aired from start to finish.\n\nHis devoted fans are still filling every arena to the brim, but White House aides said he has repeatedly expressed frustration that his speeches are not being televised.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that Trump isn't still the central character of the midterm election campaign.\n\nThe President appears in nearly 20% of all political ads this year, according to an analysis of data from Kantar Media/CMAG, based on the top 100 most competitive House and Senate races.\n\nSo far this year, at least $55 million has been spent on pro-Trump ads, the analysis found, with $61 million on anti-Trump ads.\n\nThe White House is increasingly confident about keeping control of the Senate, largely cause of the blessing of geography, with the majority of competitive seats in red states. To most places, Trump's message lingers far longer than he does because Republicans turn his rallies into 30-second commercials blasting the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"Phil whatever the hell his name is, this guy will 100% vote against us every single time,\" Trump says in an ad, attacking Phil Bredesen, the former Democratic governor running for the open Senate seat in Tennessee against Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nWhile Trump has said he will accept no blame if Republicans lose control of the House, he will have to deal with the consequences of a Democrat-controlled House investigating the White House.\n\nSuch talk has been all but suspended for now in the West Wing, two aides said, with the President not interested in discussing what happens beyond Election Day. He has previously told allies that Democrat-led impeachment or investigations could strengthen his hand going into 2020.\n\nWhatever the outcome on November 6, the midterm election campaign has solidified Trump as the indisputable leader of the Republican Party. Even old rivals like Cruz now depend on Trump's coalition for their own survival.\n\n\"I think it energizes people,\" Cruz told CNN on the eve of Trump's visit to Houston. \"I think it's going to help drive turnout. And this election is a turnout election.\"\n\nAsked whether Trump was the biggest factor, Cruz replied: \"The President is certainly a factor in the election, but I think the biggest factor in Texas is the economic boom we're seeing.\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/trump-factor-all-about-him/index.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump's midterm campaign of fear", "text": "(CNN) Donald Trump is waging one of the most inflammatory closing arguments of any modern campaign, lacing his midterm rhetoric with easily disprovable claims that are building on the fact-challenged foundation of his presidency.\n\nWith just two weeks to go before the midterm election, the President is doing what he does best, seizing national attention with a flood of outrageous and improbable lies that drown out rivals, leverage his brawling personality and rip at fault lines of race, identity and patriotism.\n\nAbove all, Trump is hardening his line on immigration, the explosive issue that is usually a winner for him, in a strategy designed to drive his loyalists to the polls to defy ominous midterm omens that haunt every first-term president.\n\nThere are signs the scorched-earth blitz is working as Trump's approval rating ticks up , offering Republicans the possibility of increasing their Senate majority and longer-shot hopes of clinging to their control of the House.\n\nBut Trump's gamble may not be universally successful. His clamorous approach could backfire in the more moderate suburban districts where the battle for the House will be decided and he ran behind Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAnd his strategy -- which is essentially a case of a President grabbing some of the most emotive, divisive political issues and demagoguing them in a fear-based campaign for his own benefit -- is likely to leave the nation more polarized and unable to reach solutions to its most pressing problems.\n\nThe President's midterm onslaught is playing out in rallies across the nation that mostly target conservative regions where he is most popular.\n\nHis latest stop was Texas, where he appeared alongside former GOP presidential primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday night.\n\n\"The Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country, the security of our nation and the safety of every American,\" Trump said, blaming Democrats for \"the crisis on our border.\"\n\nHis hardcore approach sometimes overshadows the story of success that the President has to tell and would be the top talking point for most presidents, including the lowest jobless rate in half a century, an economy that has thrived since he has been in office and the two conservative Supreme Court justices he has installed.\n\nIn his most extreme attack, Trump is accusing Democrats of organizing a migrant caravan trekking through Mexico that he says will lay siege to the US border. He has claimed without offering any evidence that the caravan includes criminals and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" Reporters walking with the caravan say it's made up of desperate Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing repression and poverty.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that there was \"absolutely\" evidence of Middle Easterners in the caravan -- but did not provide any.\n\nVehemence of rhetoric\n\nTrump is certainly not the first politician to distort the profiles and positions of his opponents or to suggest that their positions are un-American.\n\nBut the volume and vehemence of Trump's rhetoric, and his willingness to fling explosive claims even though they are demonstrably untrue is unlike any campaign in decades.\n\nIn Arizona, over the weekend for instance, a huge chunk of his speech was on immigration. Trump voters, many of whom believe politicians failed to do anything about what they see as undocumented migrants undercutting their wages and taking their jobs, see the President's rhetoric as legitimate. And they reject media critiques that the President lies and many see his unchained rhetoric as exactly the kind of anti-establishment behavior that made him an attractive candidate in the first place.\n\nThe television footage of people marching across Mexico plays directly into Trump's rhetorical law-and-order construct of a nation under siege from outside criminal elements -- no matter what the reality on the ground may be. Trump's claims are also relayed by conservative media.\n\n\"A Democratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker, smuggler, drug dealer and illegal alien on the planet. Come on in, folks,\" Trump said in Arizona.\n\n\"A Republican victory would send the message that America will enforce our borders and defend our citizens. It's important.\"\n\nTrump's tough approach has highlighted one of his most useful political assets that also makes him the most dangerous threat to the conventions of the political system in decades -- his lack of shame and willingness to make brazen arguments based on lies, which most presidents would avoid.\n\nHis energy and willingness to campaign like he is on the ballot may also be a factor.\n\n\"We've added a lot of spice to it, when I say we, maybe it's I, and others perhaps. They see that I am coming here,\" Trump said, in an interview with ABC 13 News in Houston.\n\nHow do Democrats respond?\n\nTrump's spiced up rhetoric has left Democrats facing questions about how to respond since they have no one on the national political stage with the star power of the President. Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday accused Trump of scaremongering over the border and a caravan that is still 1,000 miles away.\n\n\"He's making it sound like they're breaking through the border. This is hysteria on his part,\" Biden, a potential 2020 Democratic candidate, told CNN while campaigning in Florida.\n\nOn Saturday, the top two Democrats in Congress, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, argued that Trump's harsh turn was a sign of weakness rather than strength.\n\n\"The president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nIn some ways, Trump does not have many options but to go on such a rampage. He's built his presidency on keeping his base angry -- and in the process has alienated many more moderate voters. So only a presidential-election-level turnout from his base in a midterm election is likely to stave off big Democratic gains at a time when the opposition party is also enthusiastic.\n\nAnd he knows that immigration -- from the moment he stepped on the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to be a candidate -- is the issue that has helped him at the ballot box more than any other, despite political missteps like the separation of undocumented immigrant families and their children earlier this year.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump is President because of the immigration issue,\" Scott Jennings, a former campaign aide to Bush, told CNN on Monday.\n\n\"He wants to paint a line between a party that wants border security and a party that doesn't.\"\n\nBut former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook argued that the fragmented nature of the Senate and House races meant that Trump's immigration rhetoric represented a high-risk strategy.\n\n\"I don't think it is going to save them in these suburban areas that are so important for the House map or the gubernatorial map,\" Mook told CNN's Erica Hill.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/23/politics/donald-trump-mid-term-election-immigration-ted-cruz/index.html", "published": "2018-10-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump's making the migrant caravan a political issue. Here are the facts.", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump , in a series of tweets on Monday, claimed he would declare a \"national emergency\" over an issue that has frequently piqued his attention -- migrant caravans moving toward the United States through Central America and Mexico.\n\nHis tweets come just weeks ahead of the 2018 midterm elections and he has emphasized immigration as a key issue, without evidence accusing Democrats of pushing for overrun borders in what appears to be a naked fear campaign aimed at turning out his supporters. Immigration was a key issue in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nCrowds of migrants, estimated to be in the thousands on Monday, resumed their long journey north on Sunday into Mexico as part of a migrant caravan originating in Central America.\n\nCurrently migrants are at the Central Park Miguel Hidalgo in the center of Tapachula. Organizers plan for them to begin moving north, reaching the northern city of Huixtla, which is about 20 miles north, and resting there.\n\nThe President, in his tweets, also made several questionable claims concerning immigration and the caravan. Among them: that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" are \"mixed\" in with the caravan, that he would be cutting off foreign aid over the caravan, and that Mexican authorities failed to stop migrants from coming into Mexico.\n\nAsked later Monday about his assertion about \"unknown Middle Easterners\" in the caravan, Trump said: \"Unfortunately, they have a lot of everybody in that group.\"\n\n\"We've gotta stop them at the border and, unfortunately, you look at the countries, they have not done their job,\" he said. \"They have not done their job. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- they're paid a lot of money, every year we give them foreign aid and they did nothing for us, nothing.\"\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nAre there \"unknown Middle Easterners\" \"mixed\" into the migrant caravan?\n\nTrump tweeted \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed\" into the migrant caravan moving toward the United States. He called this a \"national emergy\" (sic).\n\nIt's unclear what \"unknown Middle Easterners\" Trump appears to be referring to in his tweet, since there have been no reports, in the press or publicly from intelligence agencies, to suggest there are \"Middle Easterners\" embedded in the caravan.\n\nA senior counterterrorism official told CNN's Jessica Schneider that \"while we acknowledge there are vulnerabilities at both our northern and southern border, we do not see any evidence that ISIS or other Sunni terrorist groups are trying to infiltrate the southern US border.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday afternoon that the administration \"absolutely\" has evidence of Middle Easterners in the caravan, \"and we know this is a continuing problem.\"\n\nHowever, she did not provide the specific evidence supporting that claim.\n\nDuring a White House conference call with surrogates regarding the caravan, a Homeland Security official said the administration is looking into a claim from Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales that his country has been able to capture around 100 terrorists. However, the official did not offer any evidence of the Middle Eastern people who Trump claims are hiding among migrants in the caravan.\n\n\"We are looking into that claim from the President Morales on the numbers,\" Jonathan Hoffman, the DHS official, said. \"It is not unusual to see people from Middle Eastern countries or other areas of the world pop up and attempt to cross our borders.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Morales claimed foreign individuals linked to terrorism were captured in the country during his administration, which began in January 2016.\n\n\"We have arrested almost 100 people highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS. We have not only detained them in our territory, they have also been deported to their countries of origin. All of you here have information to that effect,\" Morales said during a Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America event attended by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThere's no direct link or correlation between Morales' statement and Trump's assertion about the caravan on Twitter.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also did not provide any evidence to bolster the President's claim about \"unknown Middle Easterns\" in the caravan when asked for it by CNN on Monday.\n\nA department official told CNN that in fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border Protection \"apprehended 17,256 criminals, 1,019 gang members, and 3,028 special interest aliens from countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and Somalia. Additionally, (Customs and Border Protection) prevented 10 known or suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United States every day in fiscal year 2017.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not specify any Middle Eastern countries.\n\nPressed about the President's assertion that there are \"unknown Middle Easterners\" mixed in with the caravan, a State Department spokesperson said they understand there are several nationalities in the caravan and referred us to Department of Homeland Security for more information.\n\nWill the administration cut off foreign aid? Can they?\n\nTrump tweeted that because \"Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S.,\" the United States \"will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.\"\n\nIt's unclear where the administration will propose to make the cuts the President appears to be talking about, and CNN has reached out to the White House and the DHS for further information.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act prohibits the President from withholding -- or impounding -- money appropriated by Congress.\n\nNew York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said Monday that his office has reached out to the Government Accountability Office to ensure that the President does not violated the act.\n\n\"Fortunately, Congress -- not the President -- has the power of the purse, and my colleagues and I will not stand idly by as this Administration ignores congressional intent,\" Engel said in a statement.\n\nTrump has made the threat of cuts to foreign aid going to Latin American countries over migrant caravans several times over the last year.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, and with the approval of the Republican-controlled Congress, there have already been significant cuts to foreign aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries he mentioned Monday -- and the administration plans to continue making cuts in fiscal year 2019.\n\nWere authorities from Mexico unable to stop the migrant caravan from heading into the US?\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that \"Mexico's Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States.\"\n\nThere are some 7,500 people marching north as part of a migrant caravan through Mexico, caravan organizer Dennis Omar Contreras told CNN. He said the organizers did a count of participants Monday morning.\n\nHe said the migrants will leave Mexico's Tapachula for the town of Huixtla, which is located more than 20 miles northwest of their Monday morning location.\n\nWhile Mexican authorities said before the caravan's arrival that anyone who entered the country \"in an irregular manner\" could be subject to apprehension and deportation, many migrants from the caravan appear to have circumvented authorities.\n\nMexican authorities say more than 1,000 Central American migrants officially applied for refugee status in Mexico over the past three days.\n\nIt's unclear how authorities will respond to the thousands of other migrants who are marching north.\n\nWill the President declare a national emergency over the caravan?\n\nIt's unclear exactly what executive action, if any, the President will take following his tweet saying that he has \"alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National (emergency).\"\n\nPrevious administrations have ordered troops to the US southern border, and Trump issued a similar memorandum earlier this year ordering National Guard troops to be deployed to the US-Mexico border. The memo came around the same time another, smaller migrant caravan was moving toward the US through Central America.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told CNN that \"beyond the National Guard soldiers currently supporting the Department of Homeland Security on our southern border, in a Title 32, U.S. Code, section 502(f) duty status under the command and control of the respective State Governors, the Department of Defense has not been tasked to provide additional support at this time.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, referred questions about the national emergency to the White House, which did not answer to several questions for comment.\n\nDoris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and the former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, told CNN that the President's use of the term national emergency, and his potential subsequent declaration, is \"a subjective judgment.\"\n\n\"It is certainly true that the numbers that have been reported in this group are larger than anything that we've seen before this from these countries concentrated in one group,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she added that the reaction is \"disproportionate to what's happening.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it's not a genuine problem, but it's not like this is organized insurrection, in the way that its been characterized,\" she added.\n\nCNN's Catherine Shoichet, Sarah Westwood, Ryan Browne, Jennifer Hansler, Geneva Sands, Dakin Andone, Patrick Oppmann, Natalie Gall\u00f3n, Kevin Liptak and Jessica Schneider contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/donald-trump-migrant-caravan-fact-check/index.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Dean Heller": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/politics/dean-heller-trump/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "The 2018 Trump factor: It's all about him", "text": "Houston (CNN) President Donald Trump knows the November election is all about him.

Marsha Blackburn.\n\nWhile Trump has said he will accept no blame if Republicans lose control of the House, he will have to deal with the consequences of a Democrat-controlled House investigating the White House.\n\nSuch talk has been all but suspended for now in the West Wing, two aides said, with the President not interested in discussing what happens beyond Election Day.

Here are the facts.", "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump , in a series of tweets on Monday, claimed he would declare a \"national emergency\" over an issue that has frequently piqued his attention -- migrant caravans moving toward the United States through Central America and Mexico.\n\nHis tweets come just weeks ahead of the 2018 midterm elections and he has emphasized immigration as a key issue, without evidence accusing Democrats of pushing for overrun borders in what appears to be a naked fear campaign aimed at turning out his supporters. Immigration was a key issue in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nCrowds of migrants, estimated to be in the thousands on Monday, resumed their long journey north on Sunday into Mexico as part of a migrant caravan originating in Central America.\n\nCurrently migrants are at the Central Park Miguel Hidalgo in the center of Tapachula. Organizers plan for them to begin moving north, reaching the northern city of Huixtla, which is about 20 miles north, and resting there.\n\nThe President, in his tweets, also made several questionable claims concerning immigration and the caravan. Among them: that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" are \"mixed\" in with the caravan, that he would be cutting off foreign aid over the caravan, and that Mexican authorities failed to stop migrants from coming into Mexico.\n\nAsked later Monday about his assertion about \"unknown Middle Easterners\" in the caravan, Trump said: \"Unfortunately, they have a lot of everybody in that group.\"\n\n\"We've gotta stop them at the border and, unfortunately, you look at the countries, they have not done their job,\" he said. \"They have not done their job. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador -- they're paid a lot of money, every year we give them foreign aid and they did nothing for us, nothing.\"\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nAre there \"unknown Middle Easterners\" \"mixed\" into the migrant caravan?\n\nTrump tweeted \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed\" into the migrant caravan moving toward the United States. He called this a \"national emergy\" (sic).\n\nIt's unclear what \"unknown Middle Easterners\" Trump appears to be referring to in his tweet, since there have been no reports, in the press or publicly from intelligence agencies, to suggest there are \"Middle Easterners\" embedded in the caravan.\n\nA senior counterterrorism official told CNN's Jessica Schneider that \"while we acknowledge there are vulnerabilities at both our northern and southern border, we do not see any evidence that ISIS or other Sunni terrorist groups are trying to infiltrate the southern US border.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday afternoon that the administration \"absolutely\" has evidence of Middle Easterners in the caravan, \"and we know this is a continuing problem.\"\n\nHowever, she did not provide the specific evidence supporting that claim.\n\nDuring a White House conference call with surrogates regarding the caravan, a Homeland Security official said the administration is looking into a claim from Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales that his country has been able to capture around 100 terrorists. However, the official did not offer any evidence of the Middle Eastern people who Trump claims are hiding among migrants in the caravan.\n\n\"We are looking into that claim from the President Morales on the numbers,\" Jonathan Hoffman, the DHS official, said. \"It is not unusual to see people from Middle Eastern countries or other areas of the world pop up and attempt to cross our borders.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Morales claimed foreign individuals linked to terrorism were captured in the country during his administration, which began in January 2016.\n\n\"We have arrested almost 100 people highly linked to terrorist groups, specifically ISIS. We have not only detained them in our territory, they have also been deported to their countries of origin. All of you here have information to that effect,\" Morales said during a Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America event attended by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThere's no direct link or correlation between Morales' statement and Trump's assertion about the caravan on Twitter.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also did not provide any evidence to bolster the President's claim about \"unknown Middle Easterns\" in the caravan when asked for it by CNN on Monday.\n\nA department official told CNN that in fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border Protection \"apprehended 17,256 criminals, 1,019 gang members, and 3,028 special interest aliens from countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and Somalia. Additionally, (Customs and Border Protection) prevented 10 known or suspected terrorists from traveling to or entering the United States every day in fiscal year 2017.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not specify any Middle Eastern countries.\n\nPressed about the President's assertion that there are \"unknown Middle Easterners\" mixed in with the caravan, a State Department spokesperson said they understand there are several nationalities in the caravan and referred us to Department of Homeland Security for more information.\n\nWill the administration cut off foreign aid? Can they?\n\nTrump tweeted that because \"Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S.,\" the United States \"will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.\"\n\nIt's unclear where the administration will propose to make the cuts the President appears to be talking about, and CNN has reached out to the White House and the DHS for further information.\n\nHowever, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act prohibits the President from withholding -- or impounding -- money appropriated by Congress.\n\nNew York Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said Monday that his office has reached out to the Government Accountability Office to ensure that the President does not violated the act.\n\n\"Fortunately, Congress -- not the President -- has the power of the purse, and my colleagues and I will not stand idly by as this Administration ignores congressional intent,\" Engel said in a statement.\n\nTrump has made the threat of cuts to foreign aid going to Latin American countries over migrant caravans several times over the last year.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, and with the approval of the Republican-controlled Congress, there have already been significant cuts to foreign aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries he mentioned Monday -- and the administration plans to continue making cuts in fiscal year 2019.\n\nWere authorities from Mexico unable to stop the migrant caravan from heading into the US?\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that \"Mexico's Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States.\"\n\nThere are some 7,500 people marching north as part of a migrant caravan through Mexico, caravan organizer Dennis Omar Contreras told CNN. He said the organizers did a count of participants Monday morning.\n\nHe said the migrants will leave Mexico's Tapachula for the town of Huixtla, which is located more than 20 miles northwest of their Monday morning location.\n\nWhile Mexican authorities said before the caravan's arrival that anyone who entered the country \"in an irregular manner\" could be subject to apprehension and deportation, many migrants from the caravan appear to have circumvented authorities.\n\nMexican authorities say more than 1,000 Central American migrants officially applied for refugee status in Mexico over the past three days.\n\nIt's unclear how authorities will respond to the thousands of other migrants who are marching north.\n\nWill the President declare a national emergency over the caravan?\n\nIt's unclear exactly what executive action, if any, the President will take following his tweet saying that he has \"alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National (emergency).\"\n\nPrevious administrations have ordered troops to the US southern border, and Trump issued a similar memorandum earlier this year ordering National Guard troops to be deployed to the US-Mexico border. The memo came around the same time another, smaller migrant caravan was moving toward the US through Central America.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told CNN that \"beyond the National Guard soldiers currently supporting the Department of Homeland Security on our southern border, in a Title 32, U.S. Code, section 502(f) duty status under the command and control of the respective State Governors, the Department of Defense has not been tasked to provide additional support at this time.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, referred questions about the national emergency to the White House, which did not answer to several questions for comment.\n\nDoris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and the former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, told CNN that the President's use of the term national emergency, and his potential subsequent declaration, is \"a subjective judgment.\"\n\n\"It is certainly true that the numbers that have been reported in this group are larger than anything that we've seen before this from these countries concentrated in one group,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she added that the reaction is \"disproportionate to what's happening.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it's not a genuine problem, but it's not like this is organized insurrection, in the way that its been characterized,\" she added.\n\nCNN's Catherine Shoichet, Sarah Westwood, Ryan Browne, Jennifer Hansler, Geneva Sands, Dakin Andone, Patrick Oppmann, Natalie Gall\u00f3n, Kevin Liptak and Jessica Schneider contributed to this report.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/donald-trump-migrant-caravan-fact-check/index.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_Jacky Rosen": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/06/politics/womens-vote-key-states/index.html", "articles": [{"title": "The 2018 Trump factor: It's all about him", "text": "Houston (CNN) President Donald Trump knows the November election is all about him. He worries his supporters do not.\n\n\"Pretend I'm on the ballot,\" he says at most every rally, trying to awaken his supporters to the urgency of the fight for control of Congress.\n\nTwo weeks before Election Day, a new air of uncertainty hangs over the 2018 campaign that revolves almost entirely around the Trump factor.\n\nA month ago, the President seemed all but resigned that Republicans would lose the House, two people who speak to him frequently tell CNN. But his outlook has brightened in recent days, increasingly insisting he can awaken his coalition to stop -- or slow -- a Democratic wave, they say.\n\n\"If anyone can save the House, he thinks he can,\" a Republican congressman close to the President said. \"He's the only one who believes it's really possible.\"\n\nWhile most presidents distance themselves from midterm elections to avoid nationalizing the races, Trump is doing the opposite. He's all in, firing up loyal supporters and fierce critics alike.\n\n\"This will be the election of the caravan, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts and common sense,\" the President said to booming applause inside Houston's Toyota Center on Monday, boiling down his closing argument for Republicans in one crisp sentence.\n\nHere in Houston, the rally on Monday night is his 29th of the year. It follows a familiar pattern of much of his 2018 campaign travel: visiting red states filled with Trump admirers, hoping to minimize political harm by energizing his detractors.\n\nBut even in Texas, several Republican strategists expressed a palpable level of anxiety at what the President might say during his unscripted rally. Trump's sharp rhetoric on immigration, two officials said, could awaken Hispanic voters or independents in key congressional races in the state.\n\n\"We were hoping he would go to West Texas for this rally,\" a Republican strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen criticizing the President or the White House.\n\nAn analysis of Trump's travel shows where he is -- and isn't -- welcome. In deep-red Montana, for example, he's staged three rallies to try to defeat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in a race even most Republicans see as no easy task.\n\nYet he's all but steering clear of Florida -- holding no big rallies so far this fall, despite campaigning there just months ago during the GOP primary. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who's locked in a tight race to unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, has asked Trump to stay away, a GOP official said.\n\nBut as in many states, Trump remains a central theme of the race, as illustrated in dueling TV ads from Nelson and Scott.\n\n\"When President Trump asks for something that's good for him and bad for Florida, I know what I'll do. I'll say no,\" Nelson said in a recent ad. \"And we all know what Rick Scott will do. He'll say yes.\"\n\nScott responded: \"I'll work with President Trump when he's doing things that are good for Florida and America. And when I disagree, I have the courage to say so.\"\n\nSo far, the President has agreed not to campaign in Florida, but he did visit the Gulf Coast this month to survey hurricane damage. A Republican official said Trump keeps asking about the race, saying he wants to do a rally in the final week for either the Senate or governor's race.\n\nThe last time Trump spent so much time hopscotching from one roaring arena to another, he was on a victory tour, thanking voters who helped turn states from blue to red in his triumph over Hillary Clinton. But statewide GOP candidates are trailing in most of those new Trump states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the near-nightly Trump show is back, this time his rallies are no longer regularly seen live on cable television. Even his beloved Fox News had taken a pass for weeks -- until Monday night, when the Houston rally aired from start to finish.\n\nHis devoted fans are still filling every arena to the brim, but White House aides said he has repeatedly expressed frustration that his speeches are not being televised.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that Trump isn't still the central character of the midterm election campaign.\n\nThe President appears in nearly 20% of all political ads this year, according to an analysis of data from Kantar Media/CMAG, based on the top 100 most competitive House and Senate races.\n\nSo far this year, at least $55 million has been spent on pro-Trump ads, the analysis found, with $61 million on anti-Trump ads.\n\nThe White House is increasingly confident about keeping control of the Senate, largely cause of the blessing of geography, with the majority of competitive seats in red states.

He worries his supporters do not.\n\n\"Pretend I'm on the ballot,\" he says at most every rally, trying to awaken his supporters to the urgency of the fight for control of Congress.\n\nTwo weeks before Election Day, a new air of uncertainty hangs over the 2018 campaign that revolves almost entirely around the Trump factor.\n\nA month ago, the President seemed all but resigned that Republicans would lose the House, two people who speak to him frequently tell CNN. But his outlook has brightened in recent days, increasingly insisting he can awaken his coalition to stop -- or slow -- a Democratic wave, they say.\n\n\"If anyone can save the House, he thinks he can,\" a Republican congressman close to the President said. \"He's the only one who believes it's really possible.\"\n\nWhile most presidents distance themselves from midterm elections to avoid nationalizing the races, Trump is doing the opposite. He's all in, firing up loyal supporters and fierce critics alike.\n\n\"This will be the election of the caravan, Kavanaugh, law and order, tax cuts and common sense,\" the President said to booming applause inside Houston's Toyota Center on Monday, boiling down his closing argument for Republicans in one crisp sentence.\n\nHere in Houston, the rally on Monday night is his 29th of the year. It follows a familiar pattern of much of his 2018 campaign travel: visiting red states filled with Trump admirers, hoping to minimize political harm by energizing his detractors.\n\nBut even in Texas, several Republican strategists expressed a palpable level of anxiety at what the President might say during his unscripted rally. Trump's sharp rhetoric on immigration, two officials said, could awaken Hispanic voters or independents in key congressional races in the state.\n\n\"We were hoping he would go to West Texas for this rally,\" a Republican strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen criticizing the President or the White House.\n\nAn analysis of Trump's travel shows where he is -- and isn't -- welcome. In deep-red Montana, for example, he's staged three rallies to try to defeat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in a race even most Republicans see as no easy task.\n\nYet he's all but steering clear of Florida -- holding no big rallies so far this fall, despite campaigning there just months ago during the GOP primary. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who's locked in a tight race to unseat Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, has asked Trump to stay away, a GOP official said.\n\nBut as in many states, Trump remains a central theme of the race, as illustrated in dueling TV ads from Nelson and Scott.\n\n\"When President Trump asks for something that's good for him and bad for Florida, I know what I'll do. I'll say no,\" Nelson said in a recent ad. \"And we all know what Rick Scott will do. He'll say yes.\"\n\nScott responded: \"I'll work with President Trump when he's doing things that are good for Florida and America. And when I disagree, I have the courage to say so.\"\n\nSo far, the President has agreed not to campaign in Florida, but he did visit the Gulf Coast this month to survey hurricane damage. A Republican official said Trump keeps asking about the race, saying he wants to do a rally in the final week for either the Senate or governor's race.\n\nThe last time Trump spent so much time hopscotching from one roaring arena to another, he was on a victory tour, thanking voters who helped turn states from blue to red in his triumph over Hillary Clinton. But statewide GOP candidates are trailing in most of those new Trump states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile the near-nightly Trump show is back, this time his rallies are no longer regularly seen live on cable television. Even his beloved Fox News had taken a pass for weeks -- until Monday night, when the Houston rally aired from start to finish.\n\nHis devoted fans are still filling every arena to the brim, but White House aides said he has repeatedly expressed frustration that his speeches are not being televised.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that Trump isn't still the central character of the midterm election campaign.\n\nThe President appears in nearly 20% of all political ads this year, according to an analysis of data from Kantar Media/CMAG, based on the top 100 most competitive House and Senate races.\n\nSo far this year, at least $55 million has been spent on pro-Trump ads, the analysis found, with $61 million on anti-Trump ads.\n\nThe White House is increasingly confident about keeping control of the Senate, largely cause of the blessing of geography, with the majority of competitive seats in red states. To most places, Trump's message lingers far longer than he does because Republicans turn his rallies into 30-second commercials blasting the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"Phil whatever the hell his name is, this guy will 100% vote against us every single time,\" Trump says in an ad, attacking Phil Bredesen, the former Democratic governor running for the open Senate seat in Tennessee against Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nWhile Trump has said he will accept no blame if Republicans lose control of the House, he will have to deal with the consequences of a Democrat-controlled House investigating the White House.\n\nSuch talk has been all but suspended for now in the West Wing, two aides said, with the President not interested in discussing what happens beyond Election Day. He has previously told allies that Democrat-led impeachment or investigations could strengthen his hand going into 2020.\n\nWhatever the outcome on November 6, the midterm election campaign has solidified Trump as the indisputable leader of the Republican Party. Even old rivals like Cruz now depend on Trump's coalition for their own survival.\n\n\"I think it energizes people,\" Cruz told CNN on the eve of Trump's visit to Houston. \"I think it's going to help drive turnout. And this election is a turnout election.\"\n\nAsked whether Trump was the biggest factor, Cruz replied: \"The President is certainly a factor in the election, but I think the biggest factor in Texas is the economic boom we're seeing.\"", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/trump-factor-all-about-him/index.html", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump's midterm campaign of fear", "text": "(CNN) Donald Trump is waging one of the most inflammatory closing arguments of any modern campaign, lacing his midterm rhetoric with easily disprovable claims that are building on the fact-challenged foundation of his presidency.\n\nWith just two weeks to go before the midterm election, the President is doing what he does best, seizing national attention with a flood of outrageous and improbable lies that drown out rivals, leverage his brawling personality and rip at fault lines of race, identity and patriotism.\n\nAbove all, Trump is hardening his line on immigration, the explosive issue that is usually a winner for him, in a strategy designed to drive his loyalists to the polls to defy ominous midterm omens that haunt every first-term president.\n\nThere are signs the scorched-earth blitz is working as Trump's approval rating ticks up , offering Republicans the possibility of increasing their Senate majority and longer-shot hopes of clinging to their control of the House.\n\nBut Trump's gamble may not be universally successful. His clamorous approach could backfire in the more moderate suburban districts where the battle for the House will be decided and he ran behind Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAnd his strategy -- which is essentially a case of a President grabbing some of the most emotive, divisive political issues and demagoguing them in a fear-based campaign for his own benefit -- is likely to leave the nation more polarized and unable to reach solutions to its most pressing problems.\n\nThe President's midterm onslaught is playing out in rallies across the nation that mostly target conservative regions where he is most popular.\n\nHis latest stop was Texas, where he appeared alongside former GOP presidential primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday night.\n\n\"The Democrats have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country, the security of our nation and the safety of every American,\" Trump said, blaming Democrats for \"the crisis on our border.\"\n\nHis hardcore approach sometimes overshadows the story of success that the President has to tell and would be the top talking point for most presidents, including the lowest jobless rate in half a century, an economy that has thrived since he has been in office and the two conservative Supreme Court justices he has installed.\n\nIn his most extreme attack, Trump is accusing Democrats of organizing a migrant caravan trekking through Mexico that he says will lay siege to the US border. He has claimed without offering any evidence that the caravan includes criminals and \"unknown Middle Easterners.\" Reporters walking with the caravan say it's made up of desperate Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing repression and poverty.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that there was \"absolutely\" evidence of Middle Easterners in the caravan -- but did not provide any.\n\nVehemence of rhetoric\n\nTrump is certainly not the first politician to distort the profiles and positions of his opponents or to suggest that their positions are un-American.\n\nBut the volume and vehemence of Trump's rhetoric, and his willingness to fling explosive claims even though they are demonstrably untrue is unlike any campaign in decades.\n\nIn Arizona, over the weekend for instance, a huge chunk of his speech was on immigration. Trump voters, many of whom believe politicians failed to do anything about what they see as undocumented migrants undercutting their wages and taking their jobs, see the President's rhetoric as legitimate. And they reject media critiques that the President lies and many see his unchained rhetoric as exactly the kind of anti-establishment behavior that made him an attractive candidate in the first place.\n\nThe television footage of people marching across Mexico plays directly into Trump's rhetorical law-and-order construct of a nation under siege from outside criminal elements -- no matter what the reality on the ground may be. Trump's claims are also relayed by conservative media.\n\n\"A Democratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker, smuggler, drug dealer and illegal alien on the planet. Come on in, folks,\" Trump said in Arizona.\n\n\"A Republican victory would send the message that America will enforce our borders and defend our citizens. It's important.\"\n\nTrump's tough approach has highlighted one of his most useful political assets that also makes him the most dangerous threat to the conventions of the political system in decades -- his lack of shame and willingness to make brazen arguments based on lies, which most presidents would avoid.\n\nHis energy and willingness to campaign like he is on the ballot may also be a factor.\n\n\"We've added a lot of spice to it, when I say we, maybe it's I, and others perhaps. They see that I am coming here,\" Trump said, in an interview with ABC 13 News in Houston.\n\nHow do Democrats respond?\n\nTrump's spiced up rhetoric has left Democrats facing questions about how to respond since they have no one on the national political stage with the star power of the President. Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday accused Trump of scaremongering over the border and a caravan that is still 1,000 miles away.\n\n\"He's making it sound like they're breaking through the border. This is hysteria on his part,\" Biden, a potential 2020 Democratic candidate, told CNN while campaigning in Florida.\n\nOn Saturday, the top two Democrats in Congress, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, argued that Trump's harsh turn was a sign of weakness rather than strength.\n\n\"The president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nIn some ways, Trump does not have many options but to go on such a rampage. He's built his presidency on keeping his base angry -- and in the process has alienated many more moderate voters. So only a presidential-election-level turnout from his base in a midterm election is likely to stave off big Democratic gains at a time when the opposition party is also enthusiastic.\n\nAnd he knows that immigration -- from the moment he stepped on the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to be a candidate -- is the issue that has helped him at the ballot box more than any other, despite political missteps like the separation of undocumented immigrant families and their children earlier this year.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump is President because of the immigration issue,\" Scott Jennings, a former campaign aide to Bush, told CNN on Monday.\n\n\"He wants to paint a line between a party that wants border security and a party that doesn't.\"\n\nBut former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook argued that the fragmented nature of the Senate and House races meant that Trump's immigration rhetoric represented a high-risk strategy.\n\n\"I don't think it is going to save them in these suburban areas that are so important for the House map or the gubernatorial map,\" Mook told CNN's Erica Hill.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/23/politics/donald-trump-mid-term-election-immigration-ted-cruz/index.html", "published": "2018-10-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump's making the migrant caravan a political issue.

Immigration was a key issue in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nCrowds of migrants, estimated to be in the thousands on Monday, resumed their long journey north on Sunday into Mexico as part of a migrant caravan originating in Central America.\n\nCurrently migrants are at the Central Park Miguel Hidalgo in the center of Tapachula.
