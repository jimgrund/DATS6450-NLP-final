number combinations are running out", "text": "Just stop somewhere \u2014 a coffee shop, the grocery store checkout, or your office \u2014 and listen.\n\nOdds are, someone within earshot is hatching a plan to buy mansions and yachts as long as a city block. But of course, many are sure to explain, they will divert serious cash to charity after winning what lottery officials call the biggest lottery jackpot in history.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Mega Millions drawing will pay out at least $1.6 billion to winning jackpot ticket holders, if there are any, after Friday\u2019s already record-setting drawing ended with no ticket matching all six numbers. That number is \u201cuncharted territory\u201d for Mega Millions, lottery officials said.\n\nAnd the chances are rising that a winner or winners will emerge after the numbers are called.\n\nBy then, lottery officials estimate 75 percent of all number combinations will be purchased, Maryland Lottery and Gaming spokeswoman Carole Gentry told The Washington Post. There are 302,575,350 possible combinations \u2014 which are the odds of winning.\n\nThat fever has struck nationwide.\n\nOn Thursday, ahead of the last drawing, in California players were buying 200 tickets a second, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBack on the east coast on Friday, about 9,100 tickets were purchased a minute in Maryland in a two hour window ahead of the drawing, state lottery officials said.\n\nThe Virginia Lottery projects sales after Friday\u2019s drawing through Tuesday\u2019s drawing will approach $19 million, lottery spokeswoman Jennifer Mullen said. In the sales peak, as many as 12,700 tickets will be sold per minute, Mullen said.\n\nWhat\u2019s my payout if I win?\n\nThe estimated cash option is about $905 million should a winner choose to take a one-time lump sum payment instead of annual payouts over 30 years, according to Mega Millions officials.\n\nBut that\u2019s before taxes. You\u2019d get about half of that after state and federal taxes take a big bite of your winnings, the AP reported. The annual payouts would net a higher payout over time, but you would have to squirrel away enough money to buy, say, a struggling NFL team.\n\nAnd if you take the annual payouts rather than the lump sum, you may even be an eventual billionaire. The website USAMega.com breaks down what your winnings could look like after taxes for your state. Even highly taxed states like New York show figures cresting a billion dollars after 30 years of payments.\n\n[You\u2019ve won the Mega Millions jackpot! Time to hide.]\n\nIs it me, or are lottery jackpots huge these days?\n\nIt\u2019s not just you. Lottery officials count on enormous jackpots to draw in players who would ordinarily avoid participating, so last October they made two big changes. They doubled ticket prices to $2 \u2014 and tweaked the formula to make it easier to win smaller prizes but harder to win the jackpot.\n\nHere\u2019s how Mega Millions used to work: Players picked five numbers from 1 to 75 and a Mega number from 1 to 15. The odds of winning the top prize were 1 in 258,890,850.\n\nSince Mega Millions modified the formula, players now pick five numbers from 1 to 70 and a Mega number of 1 to 25. The odds of winning the jackpot are now 1 in 302,575,350.\n\nIn other words, reducing the number of balls for the first five numbers increases the chances of winning a smaller prize. But raising the number of Mega Balls makes it harder to win the jackpot. (You still win the big jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.)\n\nPowerball made similar changes to its rules in 2015. That game itself is currently at a monster jackpot, though a small one relative to Mega Millions, at $620 million ahead of Wednesday\u2019s drawing.\n\nDo people think they\u2019re going to win?\n\nThey do.\n\n\u201cI believe I already won,\u201d Joseph Rauch told Reuters, \u201cbelieve I believe in the law of attraction. So what\u2019s meant to be is already gonna be.\u201d\n\nOthers are already self-read experts on how to deal with such an enormous and public prize. \u201cI would incorporate myself as a business and become my own company,\u201d Gregory Baron said in New York City.\n\nAnd even apparent fatalists are wandering to the corner store for a shot at the jackpot.\n\nHank Kattan is 75 years old.

Beaten the odds \u2014 one in 302,575,350 \u2014 and won the largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. lottery history. Perhaps you\u2019re splitting the $1.6 billion grand prize with another winning ticket or two. Either way, you\u2019re almost certainly about to enjoy an astronomical spike in wealth.\n\nNow what?\n\nBefore you shout from the rooftops or broadcast your excitement on social media, take a deep breath and keep some practical advice in mind.\n\nTo sign or not to sign the back of the lottery ticket?\n\nThere are plenty of people who will advise you to sign the back of the lottery ticket right away. After all, what would happen if, heaven forbid, you lost the ticket? Or worse yet, if an unscrupulous person in your life took the unsigned ticket and claimed it as his or hers?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nSome states require lottery winners to be publicly identified, while in others, they can remain anonymous if they claim the prize through an anonymous trust or a limited liability company (more on that later). However, signing the back of the lottery ticket with your real name may bind you to claiming the prize under that name, thus releasing your identity to the public even if that\u2019s not what you want.\n\n[He returned the orange juice to save money \u2014 and picked up a winning $315 million lottery ticket]\n\nEarlier this year, a New Hampshire woman who won a $560 million Powerball jackpot found herself in just such a predicament: She wanted to claim the prize under an anonymous trust but had already signed the back of her ticket with her real name.\n\nA judge eventually ruled she could keep the money and her privacy but, as The Washington Post\u2019s Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reported, she lost about $14,000 in interest every day the case remained unresolved.\n\nWhat may be more advisable is keeping the ticket in a secure place, such as a safe, while you consult with an attorney.\n\nThat way, if you decide to create a trust or an LLC through which to claim your prize, you can sign the back of the ticket with the name of those entities instead.\n\nSpeaking of attorneys ...\n\n\u201cThe three phone calls I would make: lawyer, accountant, financial adviser,\u201d said Randy Zelin, a New York-based litigation attorney.\n\nA lawyer who specializes in trusts and estate planning would be ideal, but the most important thing to remember is that your privacy is paramount, Zelin said this week.\n\nA few years ago, Zelin cringed as he watched another attorney parade his clients \u2014 a Tennessee family that had won a $500 million Powerball jackpot \u2014 onto the \u201cToday\u201d show to announce their winnings.\n\n\u201cThat goes down in the annals of 'What exactly were you thinking?\u2019\u201d Zelin told CNN at the time.\n\n[So many people are buying Mega Millions tickets that number combinations are running out]\n\nAn attorney can help you navigate what you are obligated to divulge under the terms and conditions of your ticket and your state\u2019s public disclosure laws.\n\n\u201cYou want to discuss everything from the vehicle that you\u2019re going to use for the money to go to, how to handle the publicity, understanding what your rights are and your obligations are in terms of making yourself available and the use of your likeness,\u201d Zelin told The Post.\n\nThese may seem like unnecessary precautions now, but lottery winners are famously susceptible to becoming targets for everything from extortion to blackmail to even kidnapping.\n\nThere will certainly be people who approach you for handouts if your name is public.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need every family member you never heard of coming out of the woodwork,\u201d Zelin said. \u201cYou want to be as low-key and have this money lawyered and away from prying eyes as you possibly can. Just about the last thing you want to do is be public when you win.\u201d\n\nFind a good accountant and financial adviser, too\n\nMega Millions allows jackpot winners to claim the grand prize either through a onetime lump-sum cash payment or through annual payments over 30 years. In the case of Tuesday\u2019s big prize, the lump-sum cash option will be an estimated $905 million, while the annuity payments would, eventually, amount to $1.6 billion.\n\nA reliable accountant can ensure you understand the tax consequences in your state for both options. The website USAMega.com breaks down what your winnings could look like after taxes for your state.\n\n[She bought her first lottery ticket on her 18th birthday \u2014 and now she\u2019s set for life]\n\nThe benefit of the smaller lump sum, of course, is that you get more money right away. That can also be a drawback for people who are not used to wealth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently different about lottery winnings than it is about other kinds of wealth that\u2019s created,\u201d said Michael S. Arlein, a trust and estate planning lawyer. \u201cBut I think often lottery winners don\u2019t come from money, and so they instantaneously have to deal with money. One day they have none, and the next day they have a huge amount. So I think there\u2019s probably a learning curve that exists for lottery winners that doesn\u2019t exist for people who made their money over a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019ve decided whether you want to take the lump sum, a financial adviser can help ensure it\u2019s managed and invested wisely.\n\nAs The Post has reported, there are countless stories of people whose lottery winnings have vanished almost as quickly as they won it.\n\nOther lottery winners have realized that every ticket buyer\u2019s fantasy can quickly morph into a nightmare. There are myriad self-inflicted problems that can befall a person who suddenly comes into great wealth. One bought a water park, for example. Several others have gambled their winnings away, including a two-time lottery winner who ended up living in a trailer. Billie Bob Harrell Jr., who won $31 million in 1997, told his financial adviser shortly before his suicide that \u201cwinning the lottery is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many stories have we heard?\u201d Zelin said. \u201cYou\u2019re now a pi\u00f1ata if you allow yourself to be. You really need to be very smart.\u201d\n\nThe number one thing to try to hold onto is patience.\n\nMega Millions winners have between 180 days to one year from the date of the drawing to claim their prize, depending on the state in which the winning tickets were purchased.\n\nThat should allow ample time to hire a lawyer, create a trust if necessary and prepare, prepare, prepare.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything too quickly. You have time,\u201d Zelin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to make any sudden moves, and you want to be very smart about the way you handle it because things happen at about 400 miles an hour and you want to be prepared for it. There\u2019s no substitute for preparation.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA hospital worker won the Powerball.

Another claimed her co-worker had assaulted her. The third petitioner accused a police chief of raping her several times while she was volunteering in his department. And the fourth, now 30, said she was assaulted by a massage therapist.\n\nAll four cases were reviewed by the local prosecutor\u2019s office, which declined to file charges.\n\nNow the four Utah residents are using a novel approach to make their voices heard: a provision in the state\u2019s constitution that permits alleged crime victims to request that the state Supreme Court appoint a prosecutor if a district attorney refuses a case.\n\nThe constitutional clause is unique to Utah, but the concept of victim-initiated prosecution is available in other states.\n\nAttorneys for the women are optimistic that if they succeed in Salt Lake County, the ruling will create a viable blueprint for other states.\n\nSalt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill called the petition an \u201cintriguing thing that\u2019s never been challenged.\u201d Still, Gill joins a number of lawyers who worry that a successful lawsuit will pave the way for thousands of frivolous petitions in many types of cases.\n\nIn the past two years, all four women \u2014 known in their recently filed lawsuit as \u201cthe Jane Does\u201d \u2014 said they were attacked by someone they knew and reported the assault within days.\n\nJane Doe 1, now 18, told The Washington Post that she hopes to help other victims be heard.\n\nAfter the Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute the case, the teenager\u2019s high school allowed her alleged rapist back on campus.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel so vulnerable and scared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think the law will protect those who have been wronged. I don\u2019t want another girl going through this again. I want to make it easier to get help and to have the law believe you.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is the first time in Utah\u2019s 120-year history that anyone has approached the issue this way, Paul Cassell, a former federal judge and professor at the University of Utah\u2019s S.J. Quinney College of Law, told The Post.\n\nHistorically, the nation rarely questions a law enforcement decision to decline bringing charges. \u201cThe sexual assault under-prosecution problem is forcing people to reevaluate that,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of requesting sweeping interference with law enforcement decisions, the lawsuit asks for a specific ruling on a case that has been turned down for prosecution.\n\n[Police in many states could legally have sex with a person in custody \u2014 until a N.Y. rape allegation]\n\nThe suit comes amid heated national dialogue about sexual abuse, as the #MeToo movement has emboldened more women to speak out. It was further fueled by the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, which were shadowed by outrage over decades-old allegations of sexual assault.\n\nThe consensus, according to attorney Bethany Warr, who represents three of the Jane Does, is that sexual assault cases are under-prosecuted, though there are places where it\u2019s more pronounced than others.\n\n\u201cThey have a tendency to be declined by district attorneys, and fairly so \u2014 they\u2019re difficult cases,\u201d Warr said. The lawsuit aims to further the dialogue about why juries are so hard on sex-crime victims and why society has such a hard time believing them, she said.\n\nSex-crime prosecutions are widely accepted as some of the most challenging in the criminal justice system.\n\nSexual assaults rarely happen with other witnesses present, and anything that deviates from the cliche of a masked, armed man committing a rape in an alleyway adds a variable that must be explained to frequently judgmental juries.\n\nIn Salt Lake County, Cassell said, assistant district attorneys operate under outdated notions of what cases are winnable, saying that prosecutors who are fearful of losing are the real barrier to successful prosecutions.\n\nGill, who is up for reelection this year, agreed that these are difficult cases for prosecutors. But, he said, that doesn\u2019t mean his office refuses to prosecute them.\n\nAn average of 44 percent of violent crimes are reported to law enforcement and result in arrest, according to a statement released by Gill on Tuesday. Sexual crimes, he said, vary dramatically.\n\nIn Utah, 12 percent are brought forward \u2014 meaning 88 of 100 people fail to report sexual assault claims, Gill told The Post. He also said that last year, his office filed charges in 39 to 40 percent of 600 sexual assault reports, consistent with the national average.\n\nGill said there\u2019s a social stigma associated with sexual assault, and because only a small percentage are reported, a systemic attrition happens.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure out what the balance is \u2014 to reassure victims that we see and hear them, while asking if the interests of justice will be met by bringing the case forward. Can we meet the legal burden in good faith?\u201d\n\nGill pointed out that sexual assault cases have nuanced complexity. One major consideration, he said, is whether to re-traumatize a victim by having her testify in a case that would be challenging to win.\n\nDeborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Law and a former prosecutor, said, \u201cThe problem with prosecutors is that they\u2019re not just thinking about legal sufficiency, they\u2019re thinking about convictability\u201d \u2014 the likelihood that 12 jurors can be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cOften, jurors are unpersuaded because of biases and rape myths. When prosecutors take that into account in charging decisions, even anticipatorily, they\u2019re embedding them into the system.\u201d\n\nThe #MeToo movement heightened awareness of the prevalence of sexual assault. Part of the benefit is that people better understand what sexual violence looks like, which mitigates assumptions about the type of person who perpetrates these crimes and how a survivor \u201cshould\u201d behave, Tuerkheimer said.\n\nThe petitioners remain hopeful that the Utah Supreme Court, which has the petition under advisement, will direct the attorney general\u2019s office and other government agencies to file briefs in response.\n\nEach of the Jane Does wants to fight for the right to hold her alleged abuser accountable.

(Richard Drew/AP)\n\nReporter\n\nSteve Doocy was about 30 seconds into Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d when he announced a Fox News alert.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a Fox News alert!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFOX NEWS ALERT\u201d blared a big red graphic on the screen.\n\nIt turned out to be pretty much the same alert \u201cFox & Friends\u201d issued on Sunday, Saturday, Friday \u2014 and very possibly other episodes going back to mid-October: A caravan of migrants was slowly walking across Central America toward the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cThe migrant caravan in Central America is growing,\u201d Doocy said when the alert graphic stopped obscuring his face.\n\n\u201cSeven thousand strong!\u201d said his co-host Ainsley Earhardt.\n\nThey cut to live footage of a Texas border city \u2014 approximately a 400-hour walk from the caravan\u2019s position in southern Mexico \u2014 where a Fox News correspondent was stationed on the ground.\n\n\u201cIs he going to be seeing 5,000 people storm the border soon?\u201d asked Brian Kilmeade, the other co-host.\n\nYou might think so, to take a spin through the big conservative news sites.\n\n[Trump apparently misunderstands \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 joke, makes baffling tweet]\n\nThe caravan was front and center on Breitbart and the Drudge Report on Monday, as it has been often since several hundred people formed it in Honduras around Oct. 12 and started walking north.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump \u2014 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d watcher-in-chief \u2014 just called the caravan a \u201cNational Emergy\u201d on Twitter. Trump said the caravan has \u201cCriminals and unknown Middle Easterners mixed in,\u201d and the Mexican military can\u2019t stop it, and also that it was organized by Democrats to hurt Republicans in the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nHave not seen a single \u201cMiddle Easterner\u201d in the caravan, @realDonaldTrump. Have seen hundreds of women and children and babies, though. https://t.co/skzF0IEGCi \u2014 Kate Linthicum (@katelinthicum) October 22, 2018\n\nThe Washington Post, CNN, the Associated Press and many other mainstream outlets have covered the migrants' journey with considerably less foreboding, just as they did a smaller caravan that petered out before it reached the U.S. border earlier this year.\n\nAmong the 5,000 or so people who crossed the Guatemalan border into southern Mexico this weekend, Kevin Sieff reported for The Post, are a call center worker who grew up in the United States and wants to return; a wood-flooring installer who was deported from Phoenix six months ago and still has a 6-year-old son there; and uncounted families fleeing poverty or organized violence in their home countries.\n\nThey travel together for safety as they cross regions controlled by gangs and drug cartels. Most of them hope to seek asylum at the border or \u2014 more likely \u2014 to try to cross into the United States illegally.\n\nSo despite the caravan\u2019s size, it\u2019s no different in purpose than smaller mass migrations that routinely cross Central America.\n\nThe last one passed through last spring, drawing its own entourage of reporters and outraged tweets from Trump. It grew to about 1,000 people, which, it turned out, was too large for purposes of logistics, and so the caravan disbanded in Mexico City long before it reached the U.S. border.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how a group at least five times larger \u2014 apparently reliant on food and water from passersby \u2014 hopes to make it any farther.\n\nThat context was not in Monday\u2019s Fox News alert.\n\nSome of it came across later in the episode \u2014 perhaps unintentionally \u2014 when Doocy brought out a panel of four people identified as independent voters and asked about the caravan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s north of apparently 7,000 people strong,\u201d Doocy told the first independent voter, Michael Willner. \u201cHow big a problem is that, that the United States has uneven immigration laws?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think uneven immigration laws are a problem for any country, and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated,\u201d Willner said.\n\n[\u2018He chose to blow it\u2019: A rare dissent from the couch of \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 after Trump attacks Ford]\n\n\u201cBut this country is founded on immigration,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd all of us come from immigrants.\u201d\n\nDoocy tried again.\n\n\u201cBy the time it gets here, it could be 10,000. It could be 20,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat should the United States do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the mightiest country on the planet,\u201d Willner replied. \u201cI think we can handle a caravan of people, unarmed, coming to this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Doocy said, pointing to the second independent voter. \u201cCathy: real quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the immigration crisis we\u2019re seeing is a result of the failure of the two democratic parties to actually engage the issue,\u201d said Cathy Stewart, with the New York Independence Party.\n\n\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d said Doocy.\n\n\u201cInstead, they use it like a partisan football,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Doocy. And, moving on: \u201cJohn, real quick.\u201d\n\nBut John Opdyke continued the previous independent voters' line of thought.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a humanitarian crisis taking place in Central America, and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s very little honest discussion about what\u2019s actually happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Aaron?\u201d Doocy said. His voice had fallen to something like a raspy whisper.\n\n\u201cTreating this as an \u2018invasion\u2019 is a bad idea, and it\u2019s going to end horribly if it is treated such as that way,\u201d said Aaron Commey, a libertarian and the final independent voter on the panel.\n\nDoocy collected his notes and sat up on his stool.\n\n\u201cSure, but the backdrop is the midterms, so it all becomes political,\u201d he told the voters. \u201cSo let\u2019s see what happens!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Fox & Friends dispensed with Monday\u2019s migrant news alert and moved on to the subject of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe next episode airs Tuesday morning. Perhaps another Fox News alert will pop up then, too.\n\nRead more:\n\nNavigating the border: The barriers that define the U.S.-Mexico borderline", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/fox-friends-voter-panel-rebels-when-asked-about-migrant-caravan/?utm_term=.0c9b51e623e6", "published": "2018-10-22T00:00:00"}]}, "cnn_politics": {"link": "https://www.cnn.com/politics", "articles": [{"title": "Rick Scott announces that he's running for Senate, challenging Bill Nelson", "text": "Washington (CNN) Florida Republican Gov.

The numbers may not be as good as advertised for Democrats Gillum and Nelson or as bad for Republicans Ron DeSantis or Rick Scott.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, the CNN poll conducted Tuesday through Saturday shows Gillum with support from 54 percent of likely voters to 42 percent for DeSantis. That\u2019s a 12 percentage point advantage for Gillum.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate race, CNN has Nelson leading Scott among likely voters, 50 percent to 45 percent. That\u2019s a Nelson lead of 5 points.\n\nCNN has the famous brand name, but its poll might be overstating support for the Democratic candidates and understating support for the Republicans.\n\nAnother survey, from SEA Polling & Strategic Design, which generally polls for Democrats, found closer contests.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, SEA found 48 percent for Gillum to 42 percent for DeSantis among registered voters.\n\nIn the Senate race, SEA found Scott leading Nelson, 47 percent to 45 percent among registered voters.\n\nThe poll from SEA was conducted from Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nGillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, is currently the mayor of Tallahassee. Republican DeSantis was serving his third term as a member of Congress from northeast Florida until he resigned last month to campaign full time.\n\nThe candidates met for their first debate Sunday night.\n\nDemocrat Nelson is seeking a fourth term in the U.S. Senate. Republican Gov. Rick Scott can\u2019t run for a third term as governor because of term limits, so he is running against Nelson.\n\nBolstering the CNN numbers was a Quinnipiac University Poll of the Senate race released on Monday. The poll found Nelson with 52 percent support among likely voters to 46 percent for Scott.\n\nQuinnipiac hasn\u2019t released results in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nAmong the reasons to be cautious about the CNN numbers:\n\n-- Trump response \u2014 The CNN survey found more Florida voters disapprove (50 percent) than approve (42 percent) of President Donald Trump\u2019s performance, a net negative of 8 percentage points.\n\nThat\u2019s not unusual. Virtually every public opinion poll shows more disapproval than approval for the president.\n\nWhat is unusual is the comparison to the national average. RealClearPolitics reports the average of national polls shows 52 percent disapproval and 44 percent approval of Trump, a net negative of 8 points.\n\nThat\u2019s strikingly similar to the percentages CNN reported in Florida. Throughout his presidency, Trump has had notably higher favorable percentages and lower unfavorable percentages in Florida than the nation.\n\nThe Quinnipiac Poll reported Trump\u2019s approval at 46 percent positive to 51 percent negative.\n\n-- Hurricane Michael \u2014 The disruptions in electricity and phone service caused by the hurricane in the Panhandle \u2013 strong Republican territory \u2014 might change the composition of the people polled. It\u2019s impossible to know how many Panhandle voters won\u2019t participate in this year\u2019s election.\n\n-- Methodology. The CNN survey asked people to describe their affiliations, with 32 percent Democrats, 29 percent Republican, and 39 percent independent.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign said the methodology of the poll is seriously flawed, which \u201crenders the finding useless.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said the sample \u201chas more Independent voters than Democrats or Republicans and more Democrats than Republicans. However, in the 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 general elections more Republicans voted than Democrats or Independents.\u201d\n\nStephen Lawson, a DeSantis spokesman, said in a written statement that the poll shows \u201cwhy so many Americans believe that CNN peddles fake news.\u201d\n\nCNN said its mix of Democrats, Republicans and voters who have no party affiliation or are members of a third party \u201calmost exactly matches\u201d the state\u2019s registered voters.\n\n-- Outlier. Some polls are considered \u201coutliers\u201d by political professionals, meaning that for a variety of reasons they don\u2019t get a good sample and the conclusions raise skepticism. Some political analysts have suggested the CNN poll might be an outlier.\n\nUntil the CNN poll released Sunday, the RealClearPolitics polling average had Gillum and DeSantis just 1 percentage point apart, with 45.3 percent for Gillum and 44.3 percent for DeSantis. Without CNN, the RealClearPolitics average in the Senate race had Scott and Nelson tied at 46.3 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that there\u2019s been a big recent surge toward Gillum and Nelson, or the CNN poll could be an outlier.\n\nThe cable network acknowledged those possibilities in an article it published Monday about the poll. \u201cThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance. It also could be an indicator of renewed Democratic enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThe fine print\n\nIn the CNN poll, the research company SSRS used live callers to reach 759 likely voters by phone from Tuesday through Saturday. For likely voters, the pollster said the margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nSEA said it used live callers to reach 600 registered voters and said its margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nQuinnipiac surveyed 1,161 likely voters from Wednesday through Sunday using live callers.

Gillum has also consolidated Democratic support (97% favor him) in a way that DeSantis has not matched on the Republican side (88% back him).\n\nViews of Donald Trump are about as polarizing as partisanship in this race, which Trump has tweeted about multiple times.

Before the storm, public polling in mid- to late-September on these contests was mixed, with some (including surveys from Mason-Dixon and the University of North Florida) finding near-even races while others (including the Quinnipiac University and NBC News/Marist polls) gave the Democratic candidates the edge.\n\nThe CNN findings could be an outlier -- a statistical anomaly which occurs in polling by random chance.
